We are excited by what Microsoft&#8217;s advancements in a defining technology of our time, artificial intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;), can and will do for people, industry, and society and the central role AI will play in the Company&#8217;s mission to help every person and organization on the planet to achieve more. We also recognize the responsibility to ensure this world-changing technology is used responsibly. Microsoft&#8217;s work on AI is guided by a core set of principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. </p> <p>Amidst global business challenges, Microsoft revenues once again broke records in fiscal year 2023. Microsoft&#8217;s leadership and the Company as a whole achieved this through relentless focus on providing technology innovations to make our customers more productive and resilient. As a result, Microsoft delivered strong results for its shareholders, including a return of over $38&#160;billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We look forward to more opportunity ahead as we remain committed to the long-term interests of the Company&#8217;s shareholders and a broad range of stakeholders critical to the Company&#8217;s success, including employees, customers, the communities we operate in, and our partners and suppliers. </p> <p>With this in mind, Microsoft continued to provide transparency in its progress towards important environmental and social commitments, including our climate goals, our progress towards advancing diversity and inclusion across our workforce, and the Racial Equity Initiative goals we are committed to meet by 2025. For more information on these initiatives and information across a breadth of environmental, social, and governance topics, we encourage you to read the progress reports Microsoft published over the course of the past fiscal year which are available at <span>microsoft.com/transparency</span> and <span>microsoft.com/csr</span>. </p> <p>This Proxy Statement describes Microsoft&#8217;s corporate governance policies and practices that foster the Board&#8217;s effective oversight of the Company&#8217;s business strategies and practices. A key component to our effective governance is the Board&#8217;s commitment to provide oversight and perspectives reflecting a diversity of independent views. </p> <p>This year&#8217;s Board nominees represent a wide range of backgrounds and expertise. We believe our diversity of experiences, perspectives, and skills contributes to the Board&#8217;s effectiveness in managing risk and providing guidance that positions Microsoft for long-term success in a dynamically changing business environment. Of the 12 Board nominees, 11 are independent, which includes Sandra Peterson as Lead Independent Director and all committee chairs and members. We are pleased to announce the nominations of Catherine MacGregor and Mark Mason for election to the Board at our December&#160;7, 2023 Annual Meeting. Ms.&#160;MacGregor is Group CEO of Engie S.A. (&#8220;Engie&#8221;) and a member of the Engie board. She is an accomplished leader in the energy business and will bring significant insights and global experience to Microsoft. Mr.&#160;Mason is CFO of Citigroup Inc. He brings strategic and operational experience and a deep understanding of how commerce is changing globally. </p> <p>In addition, two members of the Board have decided not to seek <span>re-election</span> and will end their Board service in December: Padmasree Warrior and John Thompson. Ms.&#160;Warrior served on the Board and on the Compensation Committee for nearly eight years and has contributed valuable insights and perspectives in those roles. During his eleven-year tenure, Mr.&#160;Thompson served as both Board Chair and Lead Independent Director, led the CEO search and succession process from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella, and chaired the Governance and Nominating Committee during a fruitful period of Board refreshment and diversification. We thank them for their many contributions. </p> <p>The Proxy Statement also includes information about all of the management and shareholder proposals up for a vote at the Company&#8217;s Annual Meeting. We value your vote and we encourage you to use one of the options laid out in this proxy to vote your shares whether or not you plan to join us for the Annual Meeting. As we look ahead, we continue to see tremendous opportunities for the Company&#8217;s business and shareholder value creation, with the ability to deliver positive impacts at a global scale. We appreciate your investment in Microsoft and thank you for the trust you place in us and the opportunity to serve you and our Company as directors. </p> <p>Sincerely, </p> <p>Your Board of Directors </p>\n",

Governance and our Board of Directors </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p><span><span>Earning Trust </span></span></p> <p>Earning the trust of our customers, partners, shareholders, and other stakeholders is the foundation of our business success and is fundamental to realizing Microsoft&#8217;s mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. The Board of Directors is committed to building trust through strong corporate governance, effective oversight, and strategic engagement. Together, these ensure accountability and position Microsoft for sustained success in a turbulent world. </p> <p>Like many in the investor community, the Board and Microsoft&#8217;s leaders recognize the interconnections between corporate governance and effective business responses to pressing environmental and social challenges. In considering these challenges, Microsoft and its Board have proactively engaged with investors to learn from their perspectives and to share the Company&#8217;s approach, as well as considering best practices from our industry peers, partners, customers, and the broader business community. Microsoft&#8217;s Board and management team understand that the work the Company does across a spectrum of environmental and social areas makes an important contribution to the Company&#8217;s long-term financial performance and growth. We are committed to building and executing on strategies to help foster a healthy planet and advance a more inclusive global economy that fosters additional growth opportunities for everyone. Microsoft&#8217;s management benefits from the oversight and diverse perspectives offered by the Board and its committees, which cover a broad range of environmental, social, and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) topics, which are described throughout this Proxy Statement. </p> <p>Microsoft also gains trust from our longstanding commitments to conducting our business in ways that are principled, transparent, and accountable. The foundation of these commitments is expressed in Microsoft&#8217;s Standards of Business Conduct (&#8220;Trust Code&#8221;) at <span>aka.ms/policiesandguidelines</span> which apply to our employees, officers, Board of Directors, and our subsidiaries and controlled affiliates across the globe. The Trust Code requires not only legal compliance, but also broader commitments to address accessibility, diversity and inclusion, human rights, and privacy. In support of the Trust Code, we strive to build a workplace culture that embraces learning and fosters trust &#8211; a culture where every employee feels free to ask questions and raise concerns when something doesn&#8217;t seem right. We extend our high expectations to suppliers who do business with Microsoft, requiring them to uphold the human rights, labor, health and safety, environmental, and business ethics practices prescribed in our Supplier Code of Conduct at <span>aka.ms/scoc</span>. </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p><span><span>Concrete Commitments and Transparent Reporting on Progress </span></span></p> <p>We hold ourselves accountable by publicly reporting on our policies, practices, and performance to provide our stakeholders visibility into how we are meeting our commitments and responsibilities. We believe our position in the world demands it, and we are confident that it is critical to fostering our long-term business success. Our Reports Hub available at <span>microsoft.com/transparency</span> provides a consolidated, comprehensive view of our ESG reporting and data ranging from our carbon footprint to workforce demographics to political donations. We work to align our ESG reporting to commonly used global standards such as those provided by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (&#8220;TCFD&#8221;). In addition, we were among the first companies to align our human rights work with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and to adopt the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. </p> <p>Recognizing the interest of shareholders in establishing greater transparency about corporate political contributions, we disclose our political contributions to support candidates and ballot measures and how certain of our trade association membership dues are used for political activities. As part of our commitment to transparency, we developed the Principles and Policies for Guiding Microsoft&#8217;s Participation in the Public Policy Process in the U.S., which focuses on ensuring compliance with applicable federal and state laws and goes beyond compliance to implement what we consider leading practices in corporate accountability, transparency, integrity, and responsibility. The policy is available at <span>microsoft.com/public-policy-engagement</span>. </p> <p>The corporate governance policies and practices described throughout this Proxy Statement and the effective, engaged Board oversight they foster provide the foundation for all of our commitments. </p>\n",

      " <p>&#160;</p> <p><span><span>Engagement with Environmental and Social Topics </span></span></p> <p>Below are five important initiatives that we know are of interest to many of our shareholders and other stakeholders based on feedback we have received. A wide range of information about other environmental and social topics is available at <span>microsoft.com/csr</span>. </p> <p>Environmental Sustainability </p> <p>Our strategy for a sustainable future focuses on addressing carbon emissions, ecosystems, water, and waste. In January 2020, we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since Microsoft&#8217;s founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1&#160;billion over four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We built on this pledge by adding commitments to be water positive by 2030, zero waste by 2030, and to protect ecosystems by developing a Planetary Computer. Furthermore, we enhanced transparency by subjecting the data in our annual sustainability report to third-party review and accountability by including progress on sustainability goals as a factor in determining executive pay. We report our progress towards our 2030 goals annually at <span>aka.ms/MSFTsustainabilityreport</span> and the latest information is available at <span>microsoft.com/environment</span>. Microsoft&#8217;s Environmental, Social, and Public Policy Committee provides oversight and guidance on Microsoft&#8217;s environmental sustainability strategy and commitments. </p> <p>Responsible Artificial Intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;) </p> <p>Microsoft&#8217;s approach to Responsible AI is guided by the belief that when you create technologies that can change the world, you must also ensure that the technology is used responsibly. We are committed to creating responsible AI by design. Our work is guided by a core set of principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. We are putting those principles into practice across the Company to develop and deploy AI that will have a positive impact on society. We take a cross-Company approach through cutting-edge research, <span><span>best-of-breed</span></span> engineering systems, and excellence in policy and governance.&#160;More information and resources are available at <span><span>microsoft.com/ai/our-approach</span></span>. Microsoft&#8217;s Environmental, Social, and Public Policy Committee provides oversight and guidance to management on responsible AI policies and programs. </p> <p>Human Capital </p> <p>Microsoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds. To foster their and our success, we seek to create an environment where people can thrive and do their best work. We strive to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment that enables our global employees to create products and services that further our mission.</p> <p>Information regarding our diversity and racial equity initiatives is available at <span>microsoft.com/diversity</span> and <span><span>microsoft.com/racial-equity-initiative</span></span>, and we detail our approach to human capital management across topics ranging from culture to pay equity to learning and development and more in the &#8220;Human Capital Resources&#8221; section of our Form <span>10-K</span> for the fiscal year ended June&#160;30, 2023. Microsoft&#8217;s Board and its Compensation Committee provide oversight and guidance to management on workplace and culture. </p> <p>Privacy and Cybersecurity </p> <p>Microsoft is committed to integrating privacy and security into product, service, and technology design. As we articulate in our Privacy Principles, we value, protect, and defend privacy and empower people and organizations to control their data and have meaningful choices in how it is used. More information is available at <span>microsoft.com/privacy</span>. Microsoft&#8217;s Environmental, Social, and Public Policy Committee provides oversight and guidance on Microsoft&#8217;s privacy policies and programs. </p> <p>Cybersecurity is a central challenge in the digital age and Microsoft is in the midst of a five-year public commitment to invest $20&#160;billion to accelerate efforts to integrate cybersecurity protection by design and deliver advanced enterprise security solutions<span>.</span> Every service and product line at Microsoft has a dedicated security team as well as cross-company researchers, analysts, and other experts supporting our security products and services. We have established specialized groups such as the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center focused on threat tracking, the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit, which partners with law enforcement agencies around the world to fight cybercrime, and the Digital Threat Analysis Center, which detects, assesses, and disrupts digital threats to Microsoft, its customers, and democracies worldwide. Microsoft&#8217;s Board maintains direct oversight over cybersecurity risk. The </p>\n",

      "Board receives and provides feedback on regular updates from management regarding cybersecurity governance processes, the status of projects to strengthen internal cybersecurity, security features of the products and services we provide our customers, and the results of security breach simulations. </p> <p>Racial Equity Initiative </p> <p>We are committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity in the United States for Black and African American communities and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in employees&#8217; communities, and beyond. With input and feedback from employees and community leaders, we developed a set of actions that we believe are meaningful to improve the lived experience at Microsoft as well as drive change in the communities in which we live and work. Our Racial Equity Initiative focuses on three multi-year pillars, each containing actions and progress we expect to make or exceed by 2025. Details on the components of this important initiative and a fact sheet on our progress three years after its launch are available at <span>microsoft.com/racial-equity-initiative</span>. Microsoft&#8217;s Board, its Environmental, Social, and Public Policy Committee, and its Compensation Committee provide oversight on many aspects of the Company&#8217;s commitments through its Racial Equity Initiative. </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p id=\"toc356108_2\"><span><span>Board of Directors Oversight Roles </span></span></p> <p>Shareholders elect our Board to serve their long-term interests and to oversee management. Our Board and its committees work closely with management to provide oversight, review, and counsel related to long-term strategy, risks and opportunities, and feedback from shareholders. Our Board works with management to determine our mission and long-term strategy. It also oversees business affairs, integrity, risk management, CEO succession planning, and performs the annual CEO evaluation. Our Board looks to the expertise of its committees to provide strategic oversight in their areas of focus. Significant oversight areas are provided below. </p> <p>Strategy </p> <p>Led by our CEO, senior management develops and executes our business strategy. They manage our operations and work to model our desired culture, create innovative products, establish accountability, and control risk. Our CEO and senior management also align our structure, operations, people, policies, and compliance efforts to our mission and strategy. </p> <p>Overseeing management&#8217;s development and execution of the Company&#8217;s strategy is one of our Board&#8217;s primary responsibilities. The Board works closely with senior management to respond to a dynamic business environment. Management benefits from the insights and perspectives of a diverse mix of directors with complementary qualifications, expertise, and attributes. Senior management and other leaders from across the Company provide business and strategy updates to our Board through regular strategy-focused meetings. At meetings throughout the year, the Board also assesses the strategic alignment of the Company&#8217;s budget and capital plan, business initiatives, and its strategic acquisition and integration process. For major initiatives, such as our approach to AI, the Board engages with management on strategic vision, investments, partnerships, capital requirements, and risks. For large acquisitions such as Activision Blizzard, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Nuance Communications, the Board engages management on a broad range of considerations, such as due diligence findings, valuation, and integration planning. </p> <p><span><span>Risk&#160;Oversight </span></span></p> <p>The&#160;Board&#160;of&#160;Directors </p> <p>Effective risk management is critical to Microsoft&#8217;s ability to achieve its mission. The Board exercises direct oversight of strategic risks to the Company and other risk areas not delegated to one of the Board&#8217;s committees. For example, the Board maintains direct oversight over cybersecurity risk. The Board receives and provides feedback on regular updates from management regarding cybersecurity governance processes, the status of projects to strengthen internal cybersecurity, security features of the products and services we provide our customers, and the results of security breach simulations. The Board also discusses recent incidents throughout the industry and the emerging threat landscape. </p>\n",

      "</table> <p><span><span>Company&#160;Management </span></span></p> <p>The Board, in consultation with each of its committees, oversees Company management in exercising its responsibility managing risk. The Board relies upon senior management to supervise risk management activities within the Company. Senior management is responsible for developing a continuously improving culture of risk-aware practices to identify and manage the appropriate level of risk in pursuit of our business objectives. On a regular basis, the Board and its committees engage with our senior management, our chief risk executive and chief compliance officer, and other members of management on risk as part of broad strategic and operational discussions which encompass interrelated risks, as well as on a <span><span>risk-by-risk</span></span> basis. Senior management is supported in these efforts through the operation of our enterprise risk management program. The program involves the input of management, the enterprise risk organization, a risk management community within our business teams, and subject matter experts from across the Company, and drives the identification, prioritization, and mitigation of the Company&#8217;s most significant risks. In addition, risk management is supported by our compliance organization, investigatory teams, internal audit and external audit reviews, and our legal department. Microsoft has also established robust standards of business conduct that apply to all employees globally and provides numerous methods for employees to elevate risk concerns directly to management or through anonymous channels. </p> <p>Culture and Workplace </p> <p>Our culture isn&#8217;t what we talk or write about; it&#8217;s what we live every day. Our senior management holds itself accountable for modeling the culture we strive for. We focus on creating a respectful, rewarding, diverse, and inclusive work environment where people can thrive, where they can do their best work, where they can proudly be their authentic selves, guided by our values, and where they know their needs can be met. Key to this environment is cultivating a growth mindset, where our workforce is focused on learning, listening, and growing. </p> <p>Our employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally. Employees participate in our Employee Signals surveys, which cover a variety of topics such as thriving, inclusion, team culture, wellbeing, and learning and development. We also collect Daily Signals employee survey responses, giving us <span>real-time</span> insights into ways we can support our employees. In addition to Employee Signals and Daily Signals surveys, we gain insights through onboarding, exit surveys, internal Viva Engage channels, employee Q&amp;A sessions, and our internal AskHR Service support. The Board and the Compensation Committee engage with senior management, including Human Resources executives, across a broad range of human capital management topics. Management prepares and reviews with the Board a variety of materials including culture, succession planning and development, compensation, benefits, employee recruiting and retention, and diversity and inclusion. Additionally, each year the Compensation and Audit Committees evaluate management&#8217;s annual assessment of risk related to our compensation policies and practices, including reviewing the work of management&#8217;s Sales Incentive Compensation Governance Committee. </p>\n",

      " <p>Microsoft Board Review of Sexual Harassment and Gender Discrimination Policies </p> <p>In early 2022, the Board initiated an independent review of the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies and practices. Recognizing the importance of these issues to employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders, the Board directed that a third-party assessment be conducted to address the full scope of an advisory shareholder resolution approved by shareholders at the 2021 Annual Meeting. Throughout 2022, the law firm ArentFox Schiff LLP has worked to review and assess the&#160;Company&#8217;s policies and procedures relating to sexual harassment and gender discrimination, including reviewing the Company&#8217;s internal documents, interviewing executives and employees, and benchmarking against best practices at other companies. ArentFox provided the Board with a report detailing its findings and recommendations and Microsoft&#8217;s management team has prepared an implementation plan that addresses all the recommendations in the ArentFox report. The Board thoroughly reviewed the ArentFox report and approved the specific actions in the implementation plan. Microsoft published a full transparency report from ArentFox containing their findings and recommendations and published Microsoft&#8217;s implementation plan. Microsoft has now fully implemented the report&#8217;s recommendations and board-approved implementation plan and begun annual reporting of workplace investigations data at <span>www.microsoft.com/transparency</span>. </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p id=\"toc356108_3\"><span><span>Our Governance Structure </span></span></p> <p>Framework </p> <p>We have developed a corporate governance framework designed to ensure our Board has the authority and practices in place to review and evaluate our business operations and to make decisions independent of management. Our goal is to align the interests of directors, management, and shareholders, and comply with or exceed the requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;) and applicable laws and regulations. This framework establishes the practices our Board follows with respect to, among other things, Board composition and member selection, Board meetings and involvement of senior management, director compensation, CEO performance evaluation, management succession planning, and Board committees. The Board is committed to seeking opportunities for improvements on an ongoing basis. Each summer, the Board updates our corporate governance framework based on shareholder feedback, results from the annual shareholders meeting, the Board and committees&#8217; annual assessments, governance best practices, and regulatory developments. Our Board maintains a variety of documents detailing the directives and procedures associated with corporate governance at Microsoft, listed below.

We maintain an active dialogue with shareholders to ensure we thoughtfully consider a diversity of perspectives on issues including strategy, business performance, risk, culture and workplace topics, compensation practices, and a broad range of environmental and social topics. As noted above, the Board updates our corporate governance framework each summer based on a number of inputs, including shareholder feedback. </p> <p>Our Office of the Corporate Secretary coordinates shareholder engagement with Investor Relations and provides a summary of all relevant feedback to our Board<span>. </span>In fiscal year 2023, members of our Board and management engaged with a cross-section of shareholders owning approximately 50% of Microsoft shares. In addition, throughout the year our Investor Relations group engages with our shareholders, frequently along with Satya Nadella, our Chairman and CEO, and Amy Hood, our CFO. </p> <p>To communicate broadly with our shareholders, we also seek to transparently share relevant information through our Investor Relations website, our Annual Report, this Proxy Statement, our Reports Hub, and in posts on the Microsoft On the Issues blog. </p> <p>Board Leadership </p> <p>The Board&#8217;s independent directors elected Satya Nadella to the role of Chairman and CEO. In March 2023, the independent directors elected Sandra&#160;Peterson as Lead Independent Director. She succeeds John Thompson, who had served in the roles of Lead Independent Director or Board Chair since 2012. </p> <p>In his role, Mr.&#160;Nadella leverages his deep understanding of the business to elevate the right strategic opportunities and identify key risks and mitigation approaches for the Board&#8217;s review. As Lead Independent Director, Ms.&#160;Peterson retains significant authority including providing input on behalf of the independent directors on Board agendas and schedules, calling meetings of the independent directors, authorizing retention of outside counsel, advisors, or other consultants, setting agendas for executive sessions, leading performance evaluations of the CEO, and overseeing CEO succession planning. Additional information about the role of the Lead Independent Director is described in this Part 1 under &#8220;Board Independence&#8221; below. </p> <p>The Board does not have a policy as to whether the Chairman should be an independent director, an affiliated director, or a member of management. The independent directors annually appoint a Chairman of the Board. To ensure robust independent leadership on the Board, if the individual appointed as Chairman is not an independent director, or when the independent directors determine that it is in the best interests of the Company, the independent directors will also annually appoint a Lead Independent Director. Our Board believes its current leadership structure is appropriate because it effectively allocates authority, responsibility, and oversight between management and the independent members of our Board. It does this by giving primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, while enabling the Lead Independent Director to facilitate our Board&#8217;s independent oversight of management, promote communication between management and our Board, and support our Board&#8217;s consideration of key governance matters. The Board believes its programs for overseeing risk, as described in this Part 1 under &#8220;Risk Oversight,&#8221; would be effective under a variety of leadership frameworks and therefore do not materially affect its choice of structure. </p>\n",

      " <p>CEO Succession </p> <p>A primary responsibility of the Board is planning for CEO succession and overseeing identification and development of other members of the senior leadership team (&#8220;SLT&#8221;). The Board and the Compensation Committee work with the CEO and our Chief Human Resources Officer to plan for succession. For the CEO, the succession plan covers identification of internal and external candidates, and professional and leadership development plans for internal candidates. The Board annually reviews the CEO succession plan. The criteria used to assess potential CEO candidates are formulated based on the Company&#8217;s business strategies, and include strategic vision, leadership, and operational execution. The Board is committed to actively seeking highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool of potential CEO candidates. The Board maintains an emergency succession contingency plan that is reviewed on an annual basis by the Board and Governance and Nominating Committee. The plan identifies roles and responsibilities of individuals who would act if an unforeseen event prevented the CEO from continuing to serve. The Compensation Committee reviews with the CEO and reports to the Board on development and succession plans for the other members of the SLT. The Board may review development and succession planning more frequently as it deems necessary or desirable. </p> <p>Annual Board and Committee Evaluation Process </p> <p>The Board is committed to a rigorous self-evaluation process. The Governance and Nominating Committee annually evaluates the performance of the Board. In fiscal year 2023, the evaluation included utilizing a third-party facilitator to seek feedback from each director on the performance of the Board and each committee. The results were reported to and discussed with the Board and each relevant committee. </p> <p>Our evaluation process is designed to elicit feedback on the processes, structure, composition, and effectiveness of the Board and each committee. The evaluation results have facilitated increased Board and committee effectiveness, including driving clarity on key areas for the Board&#8217;s focus over the coming year, focus on sustainable growth strategies for the Company, and input on management development and succession planning as well as Board and committee composition and recruiting. </p> <p>Director Attendance </p> <p>Each quarter, our Board holds <span>two-day</span> meetings comprised of committee and Board meetings. At each quarterly Board meeting, time is set aside for the independent directors to meet without management present. Additional executive sessions are held as needed. </p> <p>In addition to the quarterly meetings, typically there are other regularly scheduled Board and committee meetings and several special meetings each year. Our Board met nine times during fiscal year 2023. In addition, the Board held periodic meetings dedicated to strategy topics which included presentations and discussions with members of our SLT and other senior management. </p> <p>Each director nominee attended at least 75% of the aggregate of all fiscal year 2023 meetings of the Board and each committee on which he or she served. In fiscal year 2023, the Board and committees of the Board held a total of 35 meetings. Together, the director nominees attended at least 95% of the combined total meetings of the Board and the committees on which they were members in fiscal year 2023. </p> <p>Directors are expected to attend the annual shareholders meeting, if practicable. All directors attended the 2022 Annual Meeting. </p> <p>Director Orientation and Continuing Education </p> <p>Our orientation programs are designed to familiarize new directors with our businesses, strategies, and policies and assist new directors in developing Company and industry knowledge to optimize their service on the Board. </p> <p>Regular continuing education programs enhance the skills and knowledge directors use to perform their responsibilities. These programs may include internally developed programs or programs presented by third parties. </p> <p>Director Stock Ownership Policy </p> <p>To align the interests of our directors and shareholders, our directors are required to own Microsoft shares equal in value to at least three times the base annual retainer (cash and stock) payable to a director. Each director must retain 50% of all net shares <span>(post-tax)</span> from the retainer until reaching the minimum share ownership requirement. Stock deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan for <span>Non-Employee</span> Directors counts toward the minimum ownership requirement. Each of our directors complied with our stock ownership policy in fiscal year 2023. </p>\n",

These committees have the authority to engage legal counsel or other advisors or consultants as they deem appropriate to carry out their responsibilities. Our Board has four standing committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, an Environmental, Social, and Public Policy Committee, and a Governance and Nominating Committee. </p> <p>The table below provides current membership for each Board committee, followed by a summary of each committee&#8217;s responsibilities.

In making its annual director nominations determination, the Board&#8217;s objective is to recommend a group of directors that can best ensure the continuing success of our business and represent shareholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment using its diversity of experience and perspectives. </p> <p>The Governance and Nominating Committee recommends to the Board director candidates for nomination and election during the annual shareholders meeting or for appointment to fill vacancies. The Committee works with our Board to determine the characteristics, skills, and experience for the Board as a whole and its individual members with the objective of having a board with diverse backgrounds, skills, and experience. In making its recommendations to our Board, the Committee considers the qualifications of individual director candidates applying the Board membership criteria described below. The Committee retains any search firm involved in identifying potential candidates and approves their fees. </p> <p>For all directors, we require an independent mindset, integrity, personal and professional ethics, business judgment, and the ability and willingness to commit sufficient time to the Board. Our Board considers many factors in evaluating the suitability of individual director candidates, including their general understanding of global business, sales and marketing, finance, and other disciplines relevant to the success of a large, publicly traded company; understanding of our business and technology; educational and professional background; personal accomplishment; and national, gender, age, and ethnic diversity. </p> <p>This Proxy Statement includes a table summarizing the key qualifications, skills, and attributes currently most relevant to the decision to nominate candidates to serve on the Board. As the Board strives to maintain a diverse set of skills and attributes, it also expects that each member will be able to understand and contribute meaningfully to the oversight of the range of material business, risk, and regulatory issues the Company faces. Management&#8217;s responsibility includes educating and communicating to the Board in a way that enables effective oversight of this broad set of issues. The Board is committed to actively seeking highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which new candidates are selected. We work with our search firm to ensure the candidate slate provided to the Committee includes diverse candidates. </p> <p>The Board does not believe that directors should expect to be <span>re-nominated</span> annually. In determining whether to recommend a director for <span>re-election,</span> the Committee considers the director&#8217;s participation in and contributions to the activities of the Board, the results of the most recent Board evaluation, and meeting attendance. </p> <p>When the Committee recruits new director candidates, that process typically involves either a search firm or a member of the Committee contacting a prospect to assess interest and availability. A candidate will then meet with members of the Board and Mr.&#160;Nadella, and then meet with members of management as appropriate. At the same time, the Committee and the search firm will contact references for the candidate. A background check is completed before a final candidate recommendation is made to the Board. </p> <p>Shareholders have previously elected all Board nominees, except Ms.&#160;MacGregor and Mr.&#160;Mason. In recruiting Ms.&#160;MacGregor and Mr.&#160;Mason, the Committee retained the search firm Spencer Stuart to help identify director prospects, perform candidate outreach, assist in reference checks, and provide other related services. </p> <p>The Committee assesses its efforts to maintain an effective and diverse board as part of its regular responsibilities, which include annually: </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

These guidelines are available on our website at <span>aka.ms/policiesandguidelines</span>. The guidelines either meet or are more restrictive than the definition of &#8220;independent director&#8221; in the listing requirements of Nasdaq and applicable laws and regulations. The guidelines identify categories of relationships the Board has determined would not affect a director&#8217;s independence and therefore are not considered by the Board in determining director independence. </p> <p>Following the director independence guidelines, each year and before a new director is appointed, the Board must affirmatively determine a director has no relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities as a director. Annually, each director completes a detailed questionnaire that provides information about relationships that might affect the determination of independence. Management provides the Governance and Nominating Committee and Board with relevant known facts and circumstances of any relationship bearing on the independence of a director or nominee that is outside the categories permitted under the director independence guidelines. The Committee then completes an assessment of each director considering all known relevant facts and circumstances concerning any relationship bearing on the independence of a director or nominee. This process includes evaluating whether any identified relationship otherwise adversely affects a director&#8217;s independence and affirmatively determining that the director has no material relationship with Microsoft, another director, or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with our Company. </p> <p>The Governance and Nominating Committee also considers the tenure of a director, and for longer serving directors, whether the duration of service impacts the director&#8217;s independence from management, as demonstrated by the director&#8217;s relationship with management and the director&#8217;s participation in Board and committee deliberations. The Board seeks to maintain an average tenure of 10 years or less for its independent directors as a group. </p> <p>Based on the review and recommendation by the Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board analyzed the independence of each director and nominee. The Board determined that Mses. List, MacGregor, Peterson, Pritzker, Walmsley, and Warrior, and Messrs. Hoffman, Johnston, Mason, Rodriguez, Scharf, Stanton, and Thompson meet the standards of independence under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the director independence guidelines, and applicable Nasdaq listing standards, including that each member is free of any relationship that would interfere with his or her individual exercise of independent judgment. In making its independence determination, the Committee and Board considered ordinary course transactions between Microsoft and certain related entities, for instance the purchase of software licenses by companies of which a director is an executive officer, and purchases by Microsoft of goods and services from such companies.</p> <p>Certain Relationships and Related Transactions </p> <p>We are a global company with extensive operations in the U.S. and many foreign countries. Every year, we spend billions of dollars for goods and services purchased from third parties. The authority of our employees to purchase goods and services is widely dispersed. Because of these wide-ranging activities, there may be transactions, business arrangements, or relationships with businesses and other organizations in which one of our directors, executive officers, nominees for director, or an owner of 5% or more of our stock (&#8220;5% shareholders&#8221;) or their immediate families, may also be a director, executive officer, or investor, or have some other direct or indirect material interest (&#8220;related entities&#8221;). We will refer to these transactions with related entities as related-party transactions where the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a director, executive officer, nominee for director or 5% shareholders, or immediate family member has a direct or indirect material interest. </p>\n",

      " <p>Director retainers are paid quarterly in arrears. Quarterly periods are measured beginning with the annual shareholders meeting. At the end of each quarterly period, we pay 25% of the total annual retainer to each director. The number of shares awarded each quarterly period is determined by dividing the dollar value of the stock award by the market price of our common stock as of the last business day of the period. Retainers are <span>pro-rated</span> for directors who join or leave the Board or have a change in Board role during a quarterly period. </p> <p>Directors may elect to defer and convert to deferred stock awards all or part of their annual cash retainer, and to defer receipt of all or part of their annual stock awards retainer under the Deferred Compensation Plan for <span>Non-Employee</span> Directors. Amounts deferred are maintained in bookkeeping accounts that are deemed invested in Microsoft common stock, and dividends paid on deemed investments are also deemed to be invested in our common stock. We calculate the number of shares credited by dividing the amount deferred by the closing market price of our common stock on the originally scheduled payment date. Accounts in the plan are distributed in shares of Microsoft common stock, with payments either in installments beginning on separation from Board service or in a lump sum paid no later than the fifth anniversary after separation from Board service. </p> <p>Director Compensation </p> <p>This table describes the cash and stock award portions of the annual retainer paid to each <span>non-employee</span> director who served in fiscal year 2023. Mr.&#160;Nadella received no compensation as a director or Board Chairman. He is excluded from the table because we fully describe his compensation in Part 2 &#8211; Named Executive Officer Compensation. </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

      " <p>2.&#160;Named&#160;Executive&#160;Officer&#160;Compensation </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p id=\"toc356108_8\"><span><span>A Letter from the Compensation Committee </span></span></p> <p>Dear Shareholder, </p> <p>Our executive compensation program is designed to achieve strong alignment between our long-term strategic goals and our shareholders&#8217; interests, while providing a competitive total pay opportunity to attract and retain the key executives who drive our business and develop the next generation of leaders. We are committed to continually reviewing our compensation program to ensure it is grounded in our <span><span>pay-for-performance</span></span> philosophy. </p> <p>At the beginning of fiscal 2023, we faced a changing global macroeconomic environment, including increasing inflation and rising interest rates, resulting in financial headwinds which created challenges in goal setting for our executive compensation program. We nonetheless continued to set rigorous performance goals that included meaningful year-over-year growth across our performance metrics and focused on long-term alignment of executive compensation with shareholder interests. As a result, for fiscal year 2023, the financial metric-based portion of our annual cash incentives achieved 63.61% of target, and the PSA program core metrics achieved 99.65% of target. </p> <p>Our Company continued with its active shareholder outreach program during fiscal year 2023, engaging investors representing approximately 50% of our shares outstanding. The Compensation Committee Chair and Lead Independent Director participated in calls with investors holding over 20% of outstanding shares to discuss a range of governance topics including the Board&#8217;s long-term approach to executive compensation. During fiscal year 2023, we continued to address shareholders&#8217; desire to ensure the ongoing retention and motivation of Mr.&#160;Nadella, and the independent members of the Board continue to have high confidence in Mr.&#160;Nadella&#8217;s exceptional leadership of Microsoft. The Board continues its support of a compensation structure that delivers 100% of Mr.&#160;Nadella&#8217;s equity compensation via performance stock awards. Under this program, over 95% of Mr.&#160;Nadella&#8217;s annual target compensation opportunity is performance-based. Again, for fiscal year 2023, we set Mr.&#160;Nadella&#8217;s target performance stock award at $50,000,000, which we believe is the appropriate level of equity compensation for a leader with his extraordinary capabilities and responsibilities and for a company of Microsoft&#8217;s extraordinary scale and complexity. </p> <p>We also continue to look carefully at emerging investor expectations and best practices for addressing environmental, social, and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) commitments in our executive compensation program. We have been early leaders in this practice, having included an assessment of CEO and Senior Leadership Team (&#8220;SLT&#8221;) progress on culture and diversity and inclusion since 2016 as part of the operational assessment component of the annual cash incentive under our Executive Incentive Plan. The execution of our sustainability goals is also evaluated as part of this operational assessment component under the Culture, Diversity&#160;&amp; Sustainability category. We continue to seek feedback from investors and compensation experts as we thoughtfully consider future enhancements that connect executive compensation to Microsoft&#8217;s environmental and social commitments. </p> <p>We are also pleased to report that Carlos Rodriguez was appointed as Chair of the Committee in March 2023. We continue to appreciate your support and welcome your feedback on our compensation program reflected in the following pages and look forward to continued dialogue in the future. </p> <p>Sincerely, </p> <p><span>The Compensation Committee</span> </p> <p>Carlos A. Rodriguez (Chair) </p> <p>Sandra E. Peterson </p> <p>Charles W. Scharf </p> <p>Emma N. Walmsley </p> <p>Padmasree Warrior </p>\n",

Those figures have, respectively, more than doubled ($211.9 billion), more than tripled ($72.4 billion), and nearly quadrupled ($9.68) in the intervening years. In addition to another year of consistently strong financial performance, Mr.&#160;Nadella and his leadership team have positioned Microsoft to continue to drive performance for years to come.

      " <p>Below are examples that illustrate the innovative products, services, and partnerships driving momentum and growth across the Company. </p> <p><span>Azure</span>. Azure cloud computing is perhaps the most powerful example of how Microsoft&#8217;s innovation is driving growth. Azure is a natural outgrowth of Microsoft&#8217;s DNA as a platform company. It was built to unlock a vast array of <span><span><span>infrastructure-as-a-service</span></span></span> (&#8220;IaaS&#8221;), <span><span><span>platform-as-a-service</span></span></span> (&#8220;PaaS&#8221;), and <span><span><span>software-as-a-service</span></span></span> (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;) solutions. We have developed &#8211; and continue to create &#8211; scores of offerings that build on Azure&#8217;s capabilities and multiply its usefulness. Offerings include AI services, such as Azure OpenAI Service; Azure Arc for management; Azure Synapse and Microsoft Fabric for data storage, integration, and analytics; and Power BI to glean and access data insights from across the enterprise. </p> <p>Mr.&#160;Nadella has stated we aimed to build Azure as the &#8220;world&#8217;s computer.&#8221; We&#8217;ve built a global footprint, with 68 operating regions in 24 countries. Microsoft Cloud revenue, which includes other cloud offerings such as Office 365 Commercial and Dynamics 365, exceeded $110&#160;billion, with Azure accounting for more than 50% of the total. </p> <p><span></span><span>Security</span>. Our security business has grown significantly through innovation and quickly recognizing market opportunities. We serve as a comprehensive security vendor for customers&#8217; entire range of interoperating products from Microsoft and other companies. With over one million customers, our security business surpassed $20 billion of annual revenue. We continue to drive innovations, including through Security Copilot, an AI-powered security analysis tool that combines an advanced large language model with a security-specific model informed by our 65 trillion daily signals. We are committed to further improvement, including through our plan announced in fiscal year 2022 to invest $20 billion over five years to advance our security solutions and protect customers. </p> <p><span>Microsoft 365</span>. Our Microsoft 365 solutions continue to empower employees in organizations of all sizes as we bring together the best of Office 365, Windows, and advanced cybersecurity to deliver complete cloud-based experiences tailored to the needs of our users. Commercial paid seats of Office 365 have grown to more than 382 million as customers opt for greater productivity in conjunction with a more secure experience. We are bringing those same benefits to nearly 75 million consumers who have subscribed to Microsoft 365. AI will further enhance our ability to help make customers more productive. We have announced that our Microsoft 365 Copilot offering, which brings together next-generation AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph, all within the applications that millions of people use every day, will be generally available to customers on November 1, 2023. </p> <p><span>Power Platform</span>. Power Platform is making it even easier for teams of professional and citizen developers to build end-to-end business solutions together. With over 33&#160;million monthly active users, Power Platform comprises an end-to-end suite of tools to automate workflows, create apps, build virtual agents, and analyze data. Because non-IT professionals can learn and use Power Platform, subject matter experts who are closest to the workflow can use low-code or no-code tools to improve business processes. Our recently announced Copilot for Power Platform will further enable no-code development. More than 126,000 organizations have experienced Copilot in Power Platform. </p> <p><span>GitHub</span>. GitHub is a source of dynamic innovation and a key element of Microsoft&#8217;s position as the premier developer platform. GitHub Copilot is a first-of-its-kind AI-based programmer that helps developers write better code faster. When enabled, GitHub Copilot writes up to 46% of the code, greatly increasing developer productivity. Over one million people have used GitHub Copilot and over 27,000 organizations utilize GitHub Copilot for Business. GitHub expanded features to transform it from simply a source code management platform to an entire suite for development, security, and operations, with features such as continuous integration/continuous delivery and package management in our Codespaces service. GitHub Advanced Security allows developers to scan code for vulnerabilities, secrets, tokens, and other issues that can compromise secure code, and ensure all dependencies and open-source components are up to date. </p> <p><span><span>Reinventing Productivity </span></span></p> <p>Microsoft is continually building connections between our products and services in ways that create powerful new levels of utility. </p> <p><span>Microsoft Teams</span>. Microsoft Teams, our premier communication and collaboration application which surpassed 300 million monthly active users, is one example of how we develop these synergies. Teams itself has also become a first-class platform for application development, as the number of third-party apps with more than 10,000 users increased nearly 40 percent year-over-year. Teams Premium, which meets enterprise demand for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and AI-powered intelligent recaps, surpassed 600,000 seats within five months of being released. </p> <p><span>Intelligent data</span>. A foundational element of the Microsoft Cloud is data storage and management. That is, however, only a first step toward the comprehensive digital transformation companies need to remain competitive. We designed our Intelligent Data Platform to unlock productivity, value, and insights from an enterprise&#8217;s data estate. In 2023, we introduced Microsoft Fabric, which enables the unification of data and analytics tools in one environment, establishing a single source of truth, integrated with Power </p>\n",

      "BI and designed for the utilization of AI tools and integrations. Our analytics and machine learning tools drive productivity gains by transforming unstructured data into actionable information that supports operational reliability, effective supply chain management, and rapid product innovation. </p> <p><span>Industry clouds</span>. We recognize different industries have particular business requirements. Our industry clouds bring together capabilities across the entire Microsoft Cloud, along with industry-specific customizations, to improve time to value, increase agility, and lower costs. Our Clouds for Healthcare, Financial Services, Manufacturing, and Retail leverage customized combinations of products and services to overcome business challenges specific to each of those verticals. From data governance and AI to metaverse applications, our industry clouds help companies solve common challenges and allocate resources to their highest value and most differentiating activities. </p> <p>Because sustainability is an existential priority for our society and for every business today, we offer a Cloud for Sustainability to help any organization track its carbon, water, and waste footprint to help meet its sustainability goals. Our Cloud for Nonprofit helps charitable organizations unlock the power of their data to achieve more transformative impact. </p> <p><span>Advertising.</span> Our advertising business continues to grow through differentiated offerings across our online properties and through strategic acquisitions. Our global reach and product breadth allows us to serve the needs of digital advertisers across both <span><span>business-to-consumer</span></span> advertising with Bing search engine and <span><span>business-to-business</span></span> advertising with LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. With the introduction of the new Bing in 2023, we are bringing the power of AI directly into the search experience, driving increased relevance for users and creating new monetization opportunities for marketers and publishers on the web. </p> <p><span><span>Partnering and Integrating </span></span></p> <p>We partner with many of the leading enterprise technology companies to empower customers and grow market opportunities together. In July of 2023, we announced support of Meta&#8217;s large language models on Azure and Windows. We have partnered with both Databricks and Snowflake to provide our customers with the broadest array of data and analytics solutions. We have developed a service with Oracle to accelerate adoption of Oracle workloads on Azure, making Microsoft the only public cloud with simplified direct access to Oracle databases running on Oracle Cloud. Through our collaboration with SAP, we&#8217;ve built a pathway for customers to migrate their SAP workloads to the cloud to take advantage of lower costs, increased agility, and reduced risk. Through the Azure VMware Solution, we have enabled enterprises to seamlessly move VMware-based workloads from their datacenters to Azure and integrate their VMware environments with Azure. In our rapidly growing security business, we have over 15,000 partners in our ecosystem working with us to bring better solutions and more choices to market. Now, instead of one conversation on productivity, another on infrastructure, and yet another on business applications, our customer conversation can revolve around how all these products more seamlessly merge, whether it&#8217;s our software alone, or a combination of ours and partner solutions. </p> <p>Mr.&#160;Nadella has been bold and visionary in finding strategic acquisitions that build on and enhance our core offerings. LinkedIn, with its services that help both employers and workers network, grow professionally, and find one another, has shown consistent and strong growth since we acquired it in 2016. LinkedIn revenue grew to $15 billion in fiscal year 2023. Similarly, GitHub has continued to strengthen its position as the preferred platform for developers since its acquisition in 2018 and is used by over 100&#160;million developers and 76% of the Fortune 500. </p> <p>Our acquisition of Activision Blizzard as an investment will make it easier for people to play great games wherever, whenever, and however they want. We expect the transaction will increase innovation in content creation and reduce constraints on distribution. It also significantly expands our presence in mobile, the largest segment in the gaming business. </p> <p>These examples of innovation, synergy, and partnership are far from exhaustive. They provide a view, however, into the diverse and innovative set of technologies and products Microsoft has built under Mr.&#160;Nadella&#8217;s leadership. It is a multi-faceted engine of growth that provides more avenues for continued success. The uses for Microsoft&#8217;s technology toolbox are as expansive as our customers&#8217; imaginations. Mr.&#160;Nadella has quite intentionally conditioned Microsoft&#8217;s success on that of our customers &#8211; while providing the platform and technologies on which our customers will achieve it. This is a durable strategy that can thrive through economic cycles, business disruptions, and the ever-increasing pace of change that characterizes the current global marketplace, precisely because Microsoft enables companies and individuals to successfully address those very challenges. </p> <p>Environmental and Social Leadership </p> <p>At Microsoft, we focus on four enduring commitments that are central to meeting our mission and that become even more important in the era of AI: to expand opportunity, earn trust, protect fundamental rights, and advance sustainability. As we described in Part&#160;1&#160;&#8211;Governance and our Board of Directors, we believe Microsoft&#8217;s public and strategic environmental and social commitments </p>\n",

After considering Mr.&#160;Nadella&#8217;s recommendations, our Compensation Committee also approves the annual target compensation (base salaries, target cash incentives, and equity incentive compensation) for our Named Executives, except Mr.&#160;Nadella. After considering the recommendation of our Compensation Committee, the independent members of our Board approved Mr.&#160;Nadella&#8217;s base salary, target cash incentive, and target performance stock award, providing no time-based stock awards for fiscal year 2023. </p> <p>Our Compensation Committee also retains, and seeks the advice of, Pay Governance, an executive compensation consulting firm that is independent of management. See Part 1 &#8211; Governance and our Board of Directors &#8211; Board Committees for more information on Pay Governance&#8217;s role and independence as an advisor to the Compensation Committee. </p> <p>Competitive Pay </p> <p>We compete for senior executive talent with global information technology companies, large market capitalization U.S. companies, and smaller, high-growth technology businesses, depending on the role. The current technology labor market is hyper-competitive with demand growing faster than the supply of specialized technical talent, resulting in significant increases in compensation at many of the companies with which we compete for this talent. The same conditions exist in the market for executive-level talent that can provide innovative leadership while managing at a global scale across several complex businesses. We expect these trends to continue and will work to ensure our approach to executive compensation is responsive to evolving market conditions. </p> <p>Approach to Compensation Benchmarking </p> <p>To ensure that our Board and Compensation Committee have current information to set appropriate compensation levels, we conduct an executive compensation market analysis each year that draws from third-party compensation surveys and publicly available data for a group of peer companies. We supplement this analysis with additional market information specific to each executive&#8217;s role and responsibilities, including information gleaned from our experience recruiting for executive positions at Microsoft. While this market analysis and supplemental data inform the decisions of the independent members of our Board and our Compensation Committee on the range of compensation opportunities, we do not tie Named Executive compensation to specific market percentiles. Because other companies actively recruit our executives to fill CEO and other senior leadership positions, we supplement market information with data on external opportunities potentially available to our executives. We also consider the relationship of annual target compensation among internal peers. </p> <p>In setting our fiscal year 2023 executive compensation program design and compensation levels, we considered pay practices at the largest technology and general industry companies that our Compensation Committee believes are led by executives with similarly complex roles and responsibilities. Our Compensation Committee also screened these companies to ensure they had a significant presence outside the U.S. and excluded companies in the financial services sector because of the different regulatory environment in which they operate. </p> <p>Peer Group Used for Fiscal Year 2023 Pay Analysis </p> <p>For fiscal year 2023, the Compensation Committee reviewed the evolution of our business against our historical peer group, and as a result approved the use of two peer groups to better reflect the differentiated business, talent and, in some cases, pay models, across sectors: </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

Our Compensation Committee and the independent members of our Board believe this allocation strengthens our CEO&#8217;s accountability to achieving results on the objective financial metrics that most closely align with our business strategy and provides a strong incentive for our other Named Executives to drive performance on those key initiatives, which we believe strongly contributes to our success. </p> <p>Equity incentives under the Incentive Plan were allocated 100% to target PSAs for our CEO. Equity incentives under the Incentive Plan were allocated 50% to target PSAs and 50% to stock awards with four-year vesting (&#8220;SAs&#8221;) for our other Named Executives. Our Compensation Committee and the independent members of our Board believed the 100% PSA level for our CEO will strengthen the alignment of his pay and Microsoft&#8217;s long-term performance, while the 50/50 balance between PSAs and SAs appropriately supported our long-term business goals and long-term retention incentives for our other Named Executives, while also aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. </p> <p>Base Salaries </p> <p>Our Named Executives&#8217; base salaries align with the scope and complexity of their roles, their capabilities, and competitive market conditions. </p>\n",

The independent members of our Board did not increase the base salary of Mr.&#160;Nadella, which it continued to believe was reasonable and appropriate given his role, capabilities, and experience, as well as the Company&#8217;s relative scale and performance. Our Compensation Committee also did not increase the base salaries of any of the NEOs based on a competitive market review. </p> <p>Fiscal Year 2023 Cash Incentive Awards </p> <p>We did not increase our target cash incentive opportunities in fiscal year 2023 as a percentage of base salary for the same reasons that we did not increase base salaries. For fiscal year 2023, these opportunities were: Mr.&#160;Nadella &#8211; 300%; Ms.&#160;Hood &#8211; 250%; Mr.&#160;Althoff &#8211; 250%; Mr.&#160;Smith &#8211; 250%; and Mr.&#160;Young &#8211; 200%. </p> <p>Our Compensation Committee and, for Mr.&#160;Nadella, the independent members of our Board, determined the fiscal year 2023 cash incentive awards.

We calculate Incentive Plan Revenue by adjusting GAAP Revenue for (1)&#160;the net impact of revenue deferrals, (2)&#160;credits and incentives, and (3)&#160;the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on a &#8220;constant dollar&#8221; basis by converting current period <span>non-GAAP</span> (i.e., adjusted for the items in the preceding two sentences) results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using constant exchange rates, which are determined at the outset of the current period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For fiscal year 2023, we calculated Incentive Plan Operating Income by adjusting GAAP Operating Income for the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. These Incentive Plan financial metrics differ from the <span>non-GAAP</span> financial results we report in our quarterly earnings release materials. They should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. </p>\n",

The number of shares of common stock to be earned will be based on an assessment of (1)&#160;performance against the metric goals during the applicable performance period, and (2)&#160;Microsoft&#8217;s relative TSR during the period. Microsoft&#8217;s relative TSR will not increase the shares earned for a performance period unless Microsoft&#8217;s absolute TSR for the performance period is positive. The metrics and relative weights under the fiscal year 2022 and 2023 PSAs are set forth on page&#160;47 in the table labeled Fiscal Year 2021 PSA Core Metric Performance and Payout Percentages. </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p id=\"toc356108_15\"><span><span>Section&#160;6 &#8211; Other Compensation Policies and Information </span></span></p> <p>No Significant Executive Benefits and Perquisites </p> <p>Our Named Executives are eligible for the same benefits available to our other full-time employees. In the U.S., our benefits include our section&#160;401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, health care plan, life insurance plans, and other welfare benefit programs. In addition to the standard benefits offered to all U.S. employees, we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for our U.S. executive officers and senior managers. This deferred compensation plan is unfunded, and participation is voluntary. The deferred compensation plan allows our Named Executives to defer their base salary, the cash portion of their Incentive Plan awards, and certain <span>on-hire</span> bonuses. We do not contribute to the deferred compensation plan. Named Executives are eligible for matching gifts for charitable donations above the maximum for our other U.S.-based full-time employees. </p> <p>During fiscal year 2023, we provided no executive-only perquisites or other personal benefits to our Named Executives other than matching gifts made to charitable organizations. </p> <p>Post-Employment Compensation </p> <p>Our Named Executives do not have employment contracts. No Named Executive is entitled to any payments or benefits following a change in control of Microsoft. </p> <p>Our Named Executives may be eligible for additional vesting of their outstanding SAs following termination of employment on the same terms as our other employees. Consistent with our policy for U.S. employees at all levels, our Named Executives who retire from Microsoft after (a)&#160;age 65 or (b)&#160;age 55 with 15 years of continuous service are eligible for the continuation of vesting of outstanding SAs granted at the time of the annual rewards period if the award was granted over one year before the date of retirement. A <span>pro-rata</span> portion of PSA shares will also continue vesting if the retirement occurs more than one year after the beginning of the performance period. As of June&#160;30, 2023, of our Named Executives only Mr.&#160;Nadella and Mr.&#160;Smith were retirement-eligible. All employees whose employment with Microsoft terminates due to death or total and permanent disability generally fully vest in their outstanding SAs. Our PSAs vest for the target number of shares upon death or total and permanent disability. The value of our Named Executives&#8217; SAs and PSAs that would have vested assuming a June&#160;30, 2023 termination of employment due to death or total and permanent disability, or due to retirement on that date, are set forth in the table at page&#160;55. </p> <p>In addition, our Named Executives are eligible to participate in the Microsoft Senior Executive Severance Benefit Plan (&#8220;Severance Plan&#8221;). The Severance Plan was adopted to help ensure continuity of key leaders by providing designated executives severance payments and benefits if their employment is terminated without cause. For purposes of the Severance Plan, &#8220;cause&#8221; means (i)&#160;a conviction or plea of guilty or no contest to a felony or certain misdemeanors; (ii)&#160;engaging in gross misconduct; (iii)&#160;repeated failure to substantially perform the duties of the Named Executive&#8217;s role; (iv)&#160;violation of any securities laws; or (v)&#160;violation of Microsoft&#8217;s policies designed to prevent violations of law. </p> <p>The Severance Plan payments and benefits have four components &#8211; cash, stock vesting, continued health care, and outplacement assistance &#8211; all provided by Microsoft. Cash payments consist of (i)&#160;a severance payment equal to 12 months&#8217; base salary plus target annual cash incentive award, payable in a lump sum within 60 days after termination of employment; and (ii)&#160;a <span>pro-rata</span> payment of the Named Executive&#8217;s target annual cash incentive award for the partial year of work, payable in a lump sum at the same time other Incentive Plan cash awards for the year are paid. Stock vesting applies to SAs and PSAs. SAs that otherwise would vest in the <span>12-month</span> period after employment terminates continue to vest. After the first year of the PSA performance period is completed, a <span>pro-rata</span> portion of any PSA shares will also vest, and the number of shares subject to <span>pro-ration</span> is the lesser of the target award shares or the shares that are otherwise earned and payable after the end of the performance period.

      "same terms as are available to other employees whose employment is terminated without cause. There is no <span><span>change-in-control</span></span> provision in the Severance Plan. To receive the Severance Plan payments and benefits, the Named Executive must execute a separation agreement that includes a release of claims in favor of Microsoft, confidentiality and <span>non-disparagement</span> provisions, and <span>12-month</span> <span><span>non-compete/non-solicitation</span></span> restrictions. Our Named Executives&#8217; Severance Plan benefits assuming a termination of employment without cause on June&#160;30, 2023, are set forth in the table at page&#160;55. </p> <p>Mr.&#160;Nadella participates in the Severance Plan on the same terms as our other executive officers. </p> <p>Strong Clawback Policy </p> <p>Accountability is a fundamental value of Microsoft. To reinforce this value through our executive compensation program, our executive officers, other members of the SLT, and our Chief Accounting Officer are subject to a strong &#8216;no fault&#8217; executive compensation recovery (&#8220;clawback&#8221;) policy. Under this policy, our Compensation Committee may seek to recover payments of incentive compensation in the event of a restatement, as defined under the recently approved incentive-based compensation recovery provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Nasdaq listing rules. Our Compensation Committee may also seek recovery of any incentive compensation awarded during a period where a covered executive committed a significant legal or compliance violation, irrespective of whether such violation occurred in connection with a restatement. Our executive compensation recovery policy is available on our website at <span>aka.ms/policiesandguidelines</span>. </p> <p>Robust Stock Ownership Policy </p> <p>Our executive officers and certain other senior executives are required to maintain a minimum equity stake in Microsoft. This policy embodies our Compensation Committee&#8217;s belief that our most senior executives should maintain a significant personal financial stake in Microsoft to promote a long-term perspective in managing our business. In addition, the policy helps align executive and shareholder interests, which reduces incentive for excessive short-term risk taking. Each covered executive is required to acquire and maintain ownership of shares of Microsoft common stock equal to a specified multiple of his or her base salary, which for our Named Executives ranges from 8 to 15 times base salary, as shown in the table below. Each covered executive must retain 50% of all net shares <span>(post-tax)</span> that vest until achieving his or her minimum share ownership requirement. </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

The value of SAs is reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends because dividends are not paid on SA shares until vesting. The value of PSAs is calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation valuation performed as of the date of grant by an independent third party. Because the grant date for a PSA occurs when performance targets are approved, and we approved performance targets in each of fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, PSA values in this column include: (i)&#160;for fiscal year 2023 &#8211; 33.33% of each of the fiscal year 2023 PSAs, the fiscal year 2022 PSAs, and the fiscal year 2021 PSAs; (ii)&#160;for fiscal year 2022 &#8211;33.33% of each of the fiscal year 2022 PSAs, the fiscal year 2021 PSAs, and the fiscal year 2020 PSAs; and (iii)&#160;for fiscal year 2021 &#8211; 33.33% of each of the fiscal year 2021 PSAs, the fiscal year 2020 PSAs, and the fiscal year 2019 PSAs.

Based on this information, for fiscal year 2023 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of the median employee was 250 to 1. We believe this ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item&#160;402(u) of Regulation <span>S-K</span> under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. </p> <p>We identified our median employee from among our employees as of June&#160;30, 2023, the last day of our fiscal year, excluding approximately 391 employees who became Microsoft employees in fiscal year 2023 as a result of the following business acquisitions: Fungible Inc.; Lumenisity Limited; Miburo Solutions, Inc.; Excite Hungary Kft.; and EduBrite Systems, Inc. To identify our median employee, we used a &#8220;total direct compensation&#8221; measure consisting of: (i)&#160;fiscal year 2023 annual base pay (salary or gross wages for hourly employees, excluding paid leave), which we annualized for any permanent employees who commenced work during the year, (ii)&#160;target bonuses and cash incentives payable for fiscal year 2023 (excluding allowances, relocation payments, and profit-sharing), and (iii)&#160;the dollar value of SAs and target PSAs granted in fiscal year 2023. Compensation amounts were determined from our human resources and payroll systems of record. Payments not made in U.S. dollars were converted to U.S. dollars using <span>12-month</span> average exchange rates for the year. To identify our median employee, we then calculated the total direct compensation for our global employee population and excluded employees at the median who had anomalous compensation characteristics. </p>\n",

Audit Committee Matters </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p id=\"toc356108_28\"><span><span>Audit Committee Report </span></span></p> <p>Charter and Responsibilities </p> <p>The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. It is available on our website at <span>aka.ms/policiesandguidelines</span>. The charter, which was last amended effective July&#160;1, 2023, includes a calendar that outlines the Committee&#8217;s duties and responsibilities. The Committee reviews the charter and calendar annually and works with the Board of Directors to amend them as appropriate to reflect the evolving role of the Committee. </p> <p>The Board has the ultimate authority for effective corporate governance, including oversight of the management of Microsoft. The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities by overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes of Microsoft, the audits of Microsoft&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, the qualifications and performance of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged as Microsoft&#8217;s independent auditor, and the performance of Microsoft&#8217;s internal auditor. </p> <p>The Audit Committee relies on the expertise and knowledge of management, the internal auditor, and the independent auditor in carrying out its oversight responsibilities. Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of Microsoft&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles, internal control over financial reporting, and disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws, and regulations. Management is also responsible for objectively reviewing and evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness, and quality of Microsoft&#8217;s system of internal control. Microsoft&#8217;s independent auditor, Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche LLP (&#8220;Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche&#8221;), is responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). The independent auditor is also responsible for expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Microsoft&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. </p> <p>Fiscal Year 2023 Activity </p> <p>During fiscal year 2023, the Audit Committee fulfilled its duties and responsibilities as outlined in the charter and the accompanying calendar. The Committee meets twice each quarter; once in connection with quarterly Board of Directors meetings and once to review the quarterly Form <span>10-Q</span> or annual Form <span>10-K.</span> In addition, the Committee meets as needed to address emerging accounting, compliance, or other matters, or for educational training. Specifically, the Committee: </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

Management represented to the Committee that Microsoft&#8217;s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche presented the matters required to be discussed with the Committee by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;) standards and Rule <span>2-07</span> of SEC <span>Regulation&#160;S-X.</span> This review included a discussion with management and the independent auditor of the quality (not&#160;merely the&#160;acceptability) of Microsoft&#8217;s accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant estimates and judgments, and the disclosures in Microsoft&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures relating to critical accounting policies. </p> <p>Based on the reviews and discussions described above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Microsoft&#8217;s Annual Report on Form <span>10-K</span> for the fiscal year ended June&#160;30, 2023, for filing with the SEC. </p> <p>Independent Auditor Tenure and Rotation </p> <p>As part of its auditor engagement process, the Audit Committee considers whether to rotate the independent audit firm. Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche has been Microsoft&#8217;s independent auditor since the Company&#8217;s initial public offering in 1986. Deloitte rotates its lead audit engagement partner every five years; the Audit Committee interviews proposed candidates and selects the lead audit engagement partner. The Committee selected the current Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche lead audit engagement partner beginning with the fiscal year 2020 audit. The Audit Committee believes there are significant benefits to having an independent auditor with an extensive history with the Company. These include: </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

The Committee leads the selection of the lead audit engagement partner, working with Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche with input from management. The Committee has established a policy pursuant to which all services, audit and <span>non-audit,</span> provided by the independent auditor must be <span>pre-approved</span> by the Committee or its delegate. This policy prohibits the independent auditor from providing <span>non-audit</span> services such as bookkeeping or financial systems design and implementation. The Company&#8217;s <span>pre-approval</span> policy is more fully described below in this Part 3 &#8211; Policy on Audit Committee <span>Pre-Approval</span> of Audit and Permissible <span>Non-Audit</span> Services of Independent Auditor. The Committee has concluded that the amount and nature of those services provided was compatible with maintaining the independence of Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche. In addition, Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche has provided the Committee with the written disclosures and letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant&#8217;s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Committee has reviewed these materials and discussed the firm&#8217;s independence with Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche. </p> <p>As provided in its charter, in addition to evaluating Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche&#8217;s independence, the Audit Committee performed its annual assessment of Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche&#8217;s performance as independent auditor during fiscal year 2023. The Committee assessed the performance of the Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche lead audit engagement partner and the audit team.

You may specify whether you prefer the vote to occur every year,&#160;two years, or three years, or may abstain from voting on this proposal. We expect to hold another advisory vote on the frequency of the <span><span>say-on-pay</span></span> vote at our 2029 annual meeting of shareholders. </p> <p>The option of every year,&#160;two years, or three years that receives the highest number of votes cast by shareholders will be the frequency for the advisory vote on executive compensation that has been selected by shareholders. Although this vote is not binding, the Board will consider the voting results in setting the frequency of future <span><span>say-on-pay</span></span> votes.</p> <p><span><span><span>Our Board of Directors recommends that future <span><span>say-on-pay</span></span> votes occur every year. </span></span></span></p> <p>When shareholders last voted on the frequency of the <span><span>say-on-pay</span></span> vote in 2017, the Board recommended an annual vote, which shareholders supported with 90% of votes cast. Our Board continues to believe that a <span>non-binding</span> advisory vote on executive compensation that occurs annually remains the most appropriate alternative for the Company and our shareholders. We believe that an annual vote allows our shareholders the ability to frequently communicate to us regarding their view on our executive compensation program and aligns with our practice of regularly engaging with shareholders to obtain their input on corporate governance and executive compensation matters. </p> <p>Although the vote is <span>non-binding,</span> the Board will consider the vote results in determining the frequency of future <span><span>say-on-pay</span></span> votes. The Company will announce its decision on the frequency of <span><span>say-on-pay</span></span> votes in a <span>Form&#160;8-K</span> filed with the SEC no later than 150 days after the Annual Meeting. In the future, the Board may change the vote frequency based on the nature of the Company&#8217;s compensation programs, input from our shareholders, and the Board&#8217;s views on the best way to obtain meaningful shareholder input. </p> <p id=\"toc356108_34\">Proposal&#160;4:&#160;Ratification of the Selection of Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP as our Independent Auditor for Fiscal Year 2024 </p> <p>The Audit Committee has selected Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche LLP as Microsoft&#8217;s independent auditor for fiscal year 2024. The Board asks shareholders to ratify that selection. Although current law, rules, and regulations, and the charter of the Audit Committee require the Audit Committee to engage, retain, and supervise Microsoft&#8217;s independent auditor, the Board considers the selection of the independent auditor to be an important matter of shareholder concern and is submitting the selection of Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche for ratification by shareholders as a matter of good corporate practice. As described in Part 3 &#8211; Audit Committee Matters, the Board considers the selection of Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche as Microsoft&#8217;s independent auditor for fiscal year 2024 to be in the best interests of Microsoft and its shareholders. </p> <p>Receipt of a majority of the votes cast is required to approve this proposal. If the selection of Deloitte&#160;&amp; Touche is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider the result a recommendation to consider selection of a different firm. </p> <p><span><span><span>The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the independent auditor. </span></span></span></p>\n",

We will furnish the address and number of shares held by the proponents of any of the following shareholder proposals upon receipt of a request to the Corporate Secretary for such information. </p> <p id=\"txa356108_50\"><span>Proposal&#160;5:&#160;Report&#160;on&#160;Gender-Based&#160;Compensation&#160;and&#160;Benefit&#160;Gaps&#160;(Shareholder&#160;Proposal)</span> </p> <p>National Legal and Policy Center has advised us that they intend to submit the following proposal for consideration at the Annual Meeting. </p> <p>Gender-Based Compensation/Benefits Gaps and Associated Risks </p> <p>WHEREAS: Compensation and benefits inequities persist across employee gender categories, and pose substantial risk to companies and society at large. </p> <p>Women who choose not to abort their <span>pre-born</span> children, and instead decide to raise them, suffer a pay/benefits inequity compared to their company colleagues who do choose to abort their children and who receive reimbursements for expenses such as travel and lodging, when the procedures are done in a different state from where they reside for legal or other reasons. </p> <p>There is significant expense both in aborting and in raising children, yet Microsoft Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) incentivizes the former with a subsidy and discourages the latter with no subsidy.<sup>1</sup> In fact, the latter incurs far greater expense and necessity of time out of the workplace than the former, exacerbating the compensation/benefits gap. Such policies have significant societal, operational, reputational, and competitive risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining diverse talent. </p> <p>Similarly, the Company provides health benefits to employees who suffer gender dysphoria/confusion, and who seek medical, chemical, and/or surgical treatments to aid their &#8220;transition&#8221; to their <span>non-biological</span> sex. The Company reports, &#8220;Not only was Microsoft an early leader in including sexual orientation in its corporate <span>non-discrimination</span> policy, but it continues to evolve to support employees &#8211; for instance, by broadening its health benefits to encompass medical needs for <span>US-based</span> transgender employees and their transgender dependents.&#8221;<sup>2</sup> </p> <p>The Company has staked out a position on gender dysphoria/confusion which affirms that sufferers can transition to a different sex, both psychologically and physically. Yet an increasing body of scientific evidence shows distinct harms actually result from medical and surgical &#8220;transition&#8221; treatments. Examples include various long-lasting side effects like chronic pain, sexual dysfunction, unwanted hair loss and hair gain, menstrual irregularities, urinary problems, and other complications.<sup>3</sup><sup> </sup>Rather than resolve mental health problems, such &#8220;gender affirming&#8221; care instead often exacerbates them. In such instances, patients who desire to <span>&#8220;de-transition&#8221;</span> cannot find medical or insurance coverage that they need. Many of these sufferers litigate against those who misled or mistreated them regarding the necessity and alleged &#8220;success&#8221; of &#8220;transition&#8221; therapies.<sup>4</sup> </p> <p>Resolved: Shareholders request Microsoft report on median compensation and benefits gaps across gender as they address reproductive and gender dysphoria care, including associated policy, reputational, competitive, operational and litigative risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining diverse talent. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information, litigation strategy and legal compliance information. </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

      " <p><span><span>Board Recommendation </span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal for the following reasons: </span></span></span></p> <p>COMPANY STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION </p> <p>The proponent requests Microsoft report on median compensation and benefits gaps across gender &#8220;as they address reproductive and gender dysphoria care.&#8221; Microsoft already provides pay equity and median gender and racial pay gap reporting. Based on the language of the proposal, the request for additional reporting appears to stem from animosity towards certain reproductive and gender-related health benefits. We strongly believe the requested report is unnecessary given Microsoft&#8217;s strong existing pay disclosures and the comprehensive and inclusive set of benefits we provide to Microsoft employees. We further believe such reporting would be counter-productive to our efforts to recruit and retain diverse talent. </p> <p>As a baseline of our existing pay disclosures, Microsoft has reported on pay equity since 2016 in support of our commitment to pay employees equitably for substantially similar work. To further highlight the opportunity to continue to make progress on representation at all levels of the Company, in our 2022 Global Diversity and Inclusion Report, we began disclosing the unadjusted differences in median total pay for women inside and outside of the U.S., and for racial and ethnic minorities, Asian, Black and African American, and Hispanic and Latinx employees in the U.S. </p> <p>In terms of the benefits we offer, we believe it&#8217;s our responsibility to create an environment where people can do their best work &#8211; a place where they can proudly be their authentic selves, and where they know their needs can be met. We are constantly listening to employee feedback to establish and evolve our benefits that creates a more diverse and inclusive environment and recognizes the importance of employees to the continued success of Microsoft. We&#8217;ve worked to align our benefits to our culture, as guided by this priority, evolving them to be more holistic and inclusive.</p> <p>Our industry-leading employee benefits include but are not limited to health care benefits that rank amongst the top in our industry. Far from the assertions raised in the proposal, Microsoft offers comprehensive health and wellbeing benefits for families such as paid vacation, paid sick leave, paid time off for new parents, fertility, adoption and surrogacy assistance, birthing, doula and postpartum support, caregiver leave, subsidized childcare, and more. Indeed, Microsoft places enough importance on the business benefits of paid parental leave that in 2018 we launched a new policy to ensure our U.S. suppliers offer their employees a minimum of 12 weeks paid parental leave for their employees doing significant work for Microsoft.</p> <p>As part of our commitment to inclusive benefits, Microsoft will continue to lawfully support our employees and their enrolled dependents in accessing critical healthcare regardless of where they live across the U.S., which includes travel expense assistance for lawful medical services where access to care is limited in availability in an employee&#8217;s home geographic region. </p>\n",

The report should be available within a reasonable timeframe, prepared at a reasonable expense and omit proprietary information. </p> <p>SUPPORTING STATEMENT </p> <p>Microsoft does not explicitly prohibit discrimination based on viewpoint or ideology in its written EEO policy. </p> <p>Microsoft&#8217;s lack of a company-wide best practice EEO policy sends mixed signals to company employees and prospective employees and calls into question the extent to which individuals are protected due to inconsistent state policies and the absence of a relevant federal protection. Approximately half of Americans live and work in a jurisdiction with no legal protections if their employer takes action against them for their political activities or discriminates on the basis of viewpoint in the workplace. </p> <p>Companies with inclusive policies are better able to recruit the most talented employees from a broad labor pool, resolve complaints internally to avoid costly litigation or reputational damage, and minimize employee turnover. Moreover, inclusive policies contribute to more efficient human capital management by eliminating the need to maintain different policies in different locations. </p> <p>There is ample evidence that individuals with conservative viewpoints may face discrimination at Microsoft.

(&#8220;Company&#8221;) provide a report, published on the company&#8217;s website and updated semi-annually &#8211; and omitting proprietary information and at reasonable cost &#8211; that specifies the Company&#8217;s policy in responding to requests to remove or take down content, or content-producing entities, from LinkedIn or other platforms by the Executive Office of the President, Members of Congress, or any other agency or entity of the United States Government. </p> <p>This report shall also include an itemized listing of such take-down requests, including the name and title of the official making the request; the nature and scope of the request; the date of the request; the outcome of the request; and a reason or rationale for the Company&#8217;s response, or lack thereof. </p> <p>SUPPORTING STATEMENT: In Bantam Books, Inc. vs. Sullivan (1963), and in other cases, the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that private entities may not engage in suppression of speech at the behest of government, as it has the same effect as direct government censorship. </p> <p>On July&#160;15, 2021, White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked, &#8220;Can you talk a little bit more about this request for tech companies to be more aggressive in policing misinformation? Has the administration been in touch with any of these companies and are there any actions that the federal government can take to ensure their cooperation, because we&#8217;ve seen, from the start, there&#8217;s not a lot of action on some of these platforms.&#8221; </p> <p>Psaki replied, &#8220;Sure. Well, first, we are in regular touch with these social media platforms, and those engagements typically happen through members of our senior staff, but also members of our <span>COVID-19</span> team, given, as (Surgeon General) Dr.&#160;(Vivek) Murthy conveyed, this is a big issue of misinformation, specifically on the pandemic.&#8221; </p> <p>Circumstantial evidence shows that the Company may have been the recipient of overtures, possibly from government, to censor. For example: </p> <p><span>Missouri v. Biden</span> was filed by the attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana on May&#160;5, 2022. </p> <p>A later motion for preliminary injunction highlights 1,432 facts showing that top officials in the federal government are coercing and colluding with big tech social media companies to censor free speech.<sup>1</sup> </p> <p>Dr.&#160;Robert Malone, M.D., M.S., the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology saw his LinkedIn account (a subsidiary of Microsoft Inc.) restricted and later reinstated for violating LinkedIn&#8217;s user agreement because he posted &#8220;misleading or inaccurate information&#8221; about vaccines and <span>COVID-19.</span><sup>2</sup> </p> <p>United States Republican 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said in May 2023 his LinkedIn account (a subsidiary of Microsoft Inc.) was restricted for sharing content that contains misleading or inaccurate information and later reinstated the same day.<sup>3</sup> </p> <p>Shareholders need to know whether the Company cooperates with government officials engaged in unconstitutional censorship, opening the Company to liability claims by victims. to know whether the Company fails to disclose these potential liabilities as material risks in its public filings. </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

      " <p><span><span>Board Recommendation </span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal for the following reasons: </span></span></span></p> <p>COMPANY STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION </p> <p>This proposal is unnecessary because Microsoft and LinkedIn both already provide semi-annual reports on Government Content Removal Requests and explain the principles and process used to evaluate and respond to such requests. These reports already cover the types of requests raised as a concern in the proposal. There are very few such requests disclosed for the United States because LinkedIn and Microsoft have not historically or recently received the types of requests the proposal raises as a concern. </p> <p>Microsoft issues a Content Removal Requests Report that covers government content removal requests related to Microsoft&#8217;s consumer online services (e.g., Bing, Bing Ads, OneDrive, and MSN.) The report also details Microsoft&#8217;s approach to responding to government takedown requests. When Microsoft receives a government request to remove content, we carefully review and assess the demand to understand the reason for the request, the authority of the requesting party, the applicable internal policies or terms of use for the affected product or service, and our commitments to our customers and users including with regard to freedom of expression. Based on these reviews, we determine whether and to what extent we should remove the content in question. Finally, while it does not directly relate to Government Takedown Requests, Microsoft also recently begun providing data on content removal on the Xbox Live platform related to a range of issues from sexual content to fraud. </p> <p>LinkedIn has issued reports on Government Content Removal Requests since 2018, which are updated twice yearly. Over that five-year period, the reports indicate LinkedIn received and acted on a total of two content removal requests in the U.S. The types of requests from federal officials and agencies specified in this proposal fall into the scope of this reporting. Reporting of government take down requests in the U.S. also includes requests from <span>non-federal</span> sources, such as state attorneys general or other state regulatory agencies seeking removal of fraudulent or illegal activities. </p> <p>LinkedIn&#8217;s approach to the review, analysis, and actioning of any such requests is materially the same as Microsoft&#8217;s described above. LinkedIn&#8217;s Government Requests Report posted at <span>https://about.linkedin.com/transparency</span> notes, &#8220;As part of our commitment to a safe, trusted, and professional environment, we provide as much transparency as possible about government requests for member data and content removal we receive. We believe in free expression and try to minimize the impact of laws that negatively affect constructive, relevant speech.&#8221; </p>\n",

This later became a $22&#160;billion contract for a semi-custom version of IVAS to rapidly develop, test, and manufacture a single platform that soldiers can use to fight, rehearse, and train <span>that provides increased lethality</span>, mobility, and situational awareness necessary to achieve overmatch against our current and future adversaries. </p> <p>In 2019, amidst the contract negotiation with the military, MSFT employees pushed back in a letter to the Company stating they &#8220;do not want to become war profiteers&#8221; and they &#8220;did not sign up to develop weapons&#8221; and &#8220;demand a say in how our work is used&#8221;<sup>2</sup>; </p> <p>&#8220;It will be deployed on the battlefield and works by turning warfare into a simulated &#8216;video game,&#8217; further distancing soldiers from the grim stakes of war and the reality of bloodshed,&#8221; Microsoft workers warn. Simply put, the application of HoloLens within the IVAS system is &#8220;designed to help people kill.&#8221; </p> <p>Further revelations surrounding the problematic nature are noted as &#8220;Lawmakers cited concerns over the HoloLens <span>2-based</span> device&#8217;s field tests, where the headset struggled with environmental, sight calibration, and other issues. Device assessments also explained how the headset led to soldier &#8220;impairments&#8221; such as motion sickness, headaches, and other concerns.&#8221;<sup>3</sup> </p> <p>Regardless of how our Company positions itself by making public statements, the outcome is a significant contract with the US military and Microsoft is actively working to develop what employees, other stakeholders, including shareholders, and the public view as a weapons system used in war. </p> <p>Involvement in the development of weapons poses a serious risk to a company&#8217;s reputation, especially for investors and stakeholders. Is it prudent for our Company to be identified as a weapons developer? </p> <p><span>BE IT RESOLVED, </span></p> <p>Shareholders request that the board issue an independent, third-party report, at reasonable expense and excluding proprietary information, to assess the reputational and financial risks to the company for being identified as a company involved in the development of weapons used by the military for training and/or combat purposes. </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

      " <p><span><span>Board Recommendation </span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal for the following reasons: </span></span></span></p> <p>COMPANY STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION </p> <p>Microsoft has worked with the U.S. Department of Defense on a long-standing and reliable basis for over four decades. You&#8217;ll find Microsoft technology throughout the United States military, helping power its front office, field operations, bases, ships, aircraft, and training facilities. As Microsoft bid on some significant new military contracts over the past several years, Microsoft&#8217;s Senior Leadership Team deliberated and made a principled decision that we&#8217;re not going to withhold technology from institutions that we have elected in democracies to protect the freedoms we enjoy. As technologies evolve and new capabilities emerge, we remain committed to ensuring that our military is at the forefront of that technology. </p> <p>We&#8217;ve communicated that position with employees and in external communications like blog posts. As a result, we do not believe the requested third-party analyses would advance the interests of Microsoft, its shareholders, or other stakeholders. </p> <p>To summarize our approach: </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",
      "<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n",
      "<tr>\n",
      "<td align=\"left\">&#8226;</td>\n",
      "<td>&#160;</td>\n",
      "<td align=\"left\"> <p>First, we are committed to providing our technology to the United States military and our expertise and perspective on technology issues ranging from cybersecurity to the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence. We depend on the military to defend our country, and we want it to have access to the best technology the country has to defend it, including from Microsoft. </p></td></tr></table> <p>&#160;</p>\n",
      "<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n",
      "<tr>\n",
      "<td align=\"left\">&#8226;</td>\n",
      "<td>&#160;</td>\n",
      "<td align=\"left\"> <p>Second, we will not only be active but proactive in working to address the ethical issues that new technology creates for the military. In a democratic country like the United States, where the military is accountable to civilian authorities, we believe the best way for us to address this is not to withhold our technology but rather to engage in discussions with the country&#8217;s institutions, including testimony before Congress, engagement with the Executive Branch, and the military itself. As we&#8217;ve worked to implement our own Responsible AI principles, we&#8217;ve worked to share with customers like the military our learnings and approach including our own internal Responsible AI Standard and a broad set of tools to facilitate the responsible assessment, development, and deployment of AI solutions. As we share information with those in the military and the government about AI technologies, equally we have a lot to learn ourselves by engaging with these institutions about this ethical field. </p></td></tr></table> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

      "<td align=\"left\">&#8226;</td>\n",
      "<td>&#160;</td>\n",
      "<td align=\"left\"> <p>Third, we understand that some employees may have different views. We don&#8217;t ask or expect everyone who works at Microsoft to support every position the Company takes. We also respect the fact that some employees may not wish to work on certain projects. We have an approach that ensures that people who have such concerns can raise them, and we work with them to the extent feasible to address these concerns. We&#8217;re transparent about our decision-making and will continue to have that dialogue. </p></td></tr></table> <p>In short, Microsoft has been open about its principled approach to pursuing the military contracts cited in this proposal and our broader work with the United States military and worked to help inform discussions about ethical uses of our technologies. We do not believe the third-party assessment this proposal calls for is necessary to continue our thoughtful approach. </p>\n",

If global climate goals are not met, workers face the likelihood of significant negative impacts to their retirement portfolios. Swiss Re estimates a 4% decline in global GDP by 2050 if global temperature increases are kept below two degrees Celsius but up to an 18% decline without effective mitigation.<sup>1</sup> </p> <p>Microsoft has taken actions to address climate change, including a goal to become carbon negative by 2030.<sup>2</sup> Yet, while it transitions its business away from fossil fuels, our Company&#8217;s 401(k) retirement plan (&#8220;Plan&#8221;) invests significantly in companies that contribute to climate change, jeopardizing workers&#8217; life savings. </p> <p>Microsoft offers plan participants BlackRock LifePath funds, which collectively hold the largest segment &#8211; 26% &#8211; of Plan assets.<sup>3</sup> These target retirement funds invest significantly in fossil fuel companies and companies contributing to deforestation.<sup>4</sup> By investing employees&#8217; retirement savings in companies with outsized contributions to climate change, Microsoft is generating climate risk in workers&#8217; portfolios, including both transition risk as markets shift towards a low carbon economy and long-term systemic portfolio risk. </p> <p>Federal law requires the Board to monitor its appointed fiduciaries &#8220;to ensure that their performance . . . satisfies the needs of the plan.&#8221;<sup>5</sup> The Plan&#8217;s fiduciaries must act in the best interest of their beneficiaries by considering all material risk, including climate risk, which the federal government has recently clarified is an appropriate consideration for fiduciaries.<sup>6</sup> By failing to minimize climate risk, Microsoft&#8217;s current 401(k) options risk compromising its obligation to select retirement plan investment options in the best interests of its plan participants, particularly those with retirement dates more than a decade out. </p> <p>In the increasingly competitive employee recruitment and retention landscape, failing to minimize material climate risk in its 401(k) plan options may make it more difficult for Microsoft to attract and retain top talent. Employee polling indicates that firms&#8217; environmental records are an important consideration in choosing a job.<sup>7</sup> Employee polling also reveals increasing demand for climate-safe retirement plan options.<sup>8</sup> </p> <p>Given the threat that climate change poses to employees&#8217; life savings, our Company can help ensure employee loyalty and satisfaction, and demonstrate that it is actively safeguarding all employees&#8217; retirement savings by minimizing climate risk in its Plan offerings. </p> <p><span>BE IT RESOLVED:</span> Shareholders request Microsoft publish a report, at reasonable expense and omitting confidential information, disclosing how the Company is protecting Plan beneficiaries with a longer investment time horizon from the increased future portfolio risk created by <span>present-day</span> investments in high-carbon companies. </p> <p><span>SUPPORTING STATEMENT</span>: The report should include, at Board discretion, an analysis of: </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

      " <p><span><span>Board Recommendation </span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal for the following reasons: </span></span></span></p> <p>COMPANY STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION </p> <p>This proposal mischaracterizes the operation of Microsoft&#8217;s 401(k) plan, over-simplifies or disregards the strict fiduciary framework to which the plan is subject under applicable law, and minimizes the efforts made to offer plan participants a broad range of investment options, including those that account for Environmental, Social, and Governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) factors, within that framework. We do not believe the proposed resolution for Microsoft to provide the requested report is the appropriate mechanism to ensure the prudent ongoing stewardship of the plan, in accordance with applicable law. </p> <p>Microsoft&#8217;s 401(k) plan is overseen by a management-level fiduciary committee, which utilizes several investment advisors, including a third-party fiduciary investment consultant. The committee has worked diligently to offer participants a broad range of investment strategies across different asset classes and investment styles, to allow participants to diversify their investments and pursue their individual retirement objectives based on their own risk tolerance. This includes access to investment options that take into account or specifically focus on green energy and climate solutions, in accordance with the committee&#8217;s fiduciary duties. </p> <p>The proposal incorrectly asserts or implies that <span>Microsoft</span> is &#8220;investing employees&#8217; retirement savings&#8221; in the BlackRock LifePath target date funds, or certain other available strategies, which allegedly make outsized contributions to climate change. To the contrary, almost all participants in the plan are required to affirmatively elect their own investments amongst a broad range of diverse strategies. Indeed, as the proposal itself acknowledges, the vast majority of plan assets currently <span>are not</span> invested in the BlackRock LifePath funds. The Microsoft 401(k) plan offers a carefully curated and closely monitored investment lineup, in accordance with the strict fiduciary requirements imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;), as implemented by Department of Labor regulations and guidance. </p> <p>In November 2022, the Department of Labor issued amended final rules relating to fiduciaries&#8217; consideration of ESG or other factors in selecting plan investment alternatives.<sup>1</sup> In accordance with those rules, the plan&#8217;s governing investment guidelines provide maximum flexibility under the law with regard to the consideration of ESG and other factors. The plan&#8217;s fiduciary committee is committed to evaluating plan offerings on an ongoing basis with due consideration of any changes in the law and the investment marketplace as a whole. </p> <p>Of note, nearly all of the investment managers for funds offered in the Microsoft 401(k) plan&#8217;s core lineup are signatories to the UN Principles on Responsible Investment, and all plan investments already incorporate ESG factors into their investment process and practices, to varying extents. </p> <p>Recognizing the diverse interests of employees and participants in having access to a wide range of additional investment options and strategies, including funds focused on green energy and other ESG initiatives, the Microsoft 401(k) plan&#8217;s self-directed brokerage window offers hundreds of <span>ESG-themed</span> options. The plan also has made a number of enhancements to streamline and simplify the process for enrolling in the self-directed brokerage window and filtering available investment options to identify those that are classified as <span>ESG-themed.</span> For example, Microsoft worked with the plan&#8217;s recordkeeper to facilitate a <span>one-click</span> search tool to identify the numerous available &#8220;Socially Responsible Investment&#8221; options, and regular email communications to plan participants specifically call out that tool as a resource. </p> <p>In summary, the Microsoft 401(k) plan offers participants a broad range of core investment options in accordance with prevailing ERISA fiduciary standards, and all investment managers for those offerings analyze ESG factors in their investment process and practices. The plan also allows participants to choose from a wide range of other investment alternatives, including hundreds of climate-friendly and other <span>ESG-themed</span> options that can be easily identified and filtered, via the self-directed brokerage window. The proposal does not account for the current operations of the Microsoft 401(k) plan or the strict fiduciary framework under ERISA. Moreover, the requested report would require an unnecessary expenditure of company resources, and would not affect the menu of funds actually available for selection in the plan. </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

In November 2021, the European Union approved a directive to implement a form of public CbCR for multinationals operating in the European Union with group revenue of over $860&#160;million.<sup>6</sup><sup> </sup> </p> <p>In April 2023, Australia introduced legislation which calls for multinational corporations of a certain size, operating in Australia to publicly disclose the information in their <span><span>Country-by-Country</span></span> reports (CbCr) broken down by jurisdiction, as well as publicly disclosing other new tax and financial information &#8211; also by each jurisdiction &#8211; not currently disclosed in confidential CbCr. The disclosures called for in the legislation are largely adopted from GRI Standard 207.<sup>7</sup> </p> <p>Currently, Microsoft does not disclose revenues or profits in <span>non-US</span> markets, and foreign tax payments are not disaggregated, challenging investors&#8217; ability to evaluate the risks to our company of taxation reforms, or whether Microsoft is engaged in responsible tax practices that ensure long term value creation for the company and the communities in which it operates. Microsoft&#8217;s approach to taxation has been repeatedly challenged by tax authorities globally.<sup>8</sup> In 2020, an Irish subsidiary recorded profits of $315&#160;billion, despite having no employees.<sup>9</sup><sup> </sup> </p> <p>The GRI Standards are the world&#8217;s most utilized reporting standard.<sup>10</sup> The GRI Tax Standard was developed in response to investor concerns regarding the lack of corporate tax transparency and the impact of tax avoidance on governments&#8217; ability to fund services and support sustainable development.<sup>11</sup> It is the first comprehensive, global standard for public tax disclosure and requires public reporting of a company&#8217;s business activities, including revenues, profits and losses, and tax payments within each jurisdiction.<sup>12</sup><sup> </sup> </p> <p>Oxfam America reports that investors with more than $10 trillion in assets under management have expressed public support for CbCR.<sup>12</sup> </p> <p>This proposal would bring our company&#8217;s disclosures in line with leading companies who already report using the Tax Standard.<sup>13</sup> Our company already reports CbCR information to OECD tax authorities privately, so any increased reporting burden is negligible. </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

      " <p><span><span>Board Recommendation </span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal for the following reasons: </span></span></span></p> <p>COMPANY STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION </p> <p>The tax transparency report the proposal requests is unnecessary because we provide abundant disclosure about our tax situation in multiple jurisdictions through existing frameworks. In addition, we support broad-based international tax reform and policies that foster economic growth, investment, and job creation. We comply with the tax laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate. As provided in its charter, the Audit Committee of the Microsoft Board of Directors oversees our tax strategy and compliance, reviewing with management the Company&#8217;s <span>tax-related</span> policies and processes. This includes regular reports on tax compliance, tax reform initiatives, and other developments in the U.S. and worldwide. </p> <p>First, as noted, we already provide extensive tax information in a variety of forums. Our Annual Report on Form <span>10-K</span> filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission provides detailed information regarding our U.S. federal, state, and international income taxes and other tax related information for the years covered by the report. <span>Fifty-One</span> Microsoft subsidiaries currently file statutory reports which are publicly available. Microsoft also publishes tax strategy statements as required in the United Kingdom, Poland, and Singapore which set out our approach to managing the Company&#8217;s tax affairs. </p> <p>In addition, Microsoft currently provides annual <span><span>country-by-country</span></span> reports on a confidential basis to tax authorities as agreed by countries participating in the Organization for Economic Cooperation&#160;&amp; Development (&#8220;OECD&#8221;). These reports include specific tax information by country and are shared among tax authorities providing them with information to undertake a high-level risk assessment of our tax affairs. Confidentiality of this information and sharing only through information exchange networks established by treaty was key to the multinational OECD agreement, due to its competitively sensitive nature and the need to ensure appropriate use by treaty and information exchange partners. </p> <p>Although public <span><span>country-by-country</span></span> reporting is not currently required, Microsoft expects to comply with European Union public <span><span>country-by-country</span></span> reporting requirements as required effective for our fiscal year 2025. </p> <p>Second, we support tax reform and transparency through ongoing, orderly, multilateral processes. Microsoft has expressed support for the OECD&#8217;s multilateral international tax reform efforts, with a signed agreement expected in 2023. On July&#160;11, 2023, 138 members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (&#8220;BEPS&#8221;) &#8211; representing over 90% of global GDP &#8211; agreed an Outcome Statement recognizing the significant progress made and allowing countries and jurisdictions to move forward with historic, major reform of the international tax system. These multilateral efforts should be allowed to progress through the negotiation and cooperation of governments, businesses, and other interested stakeholders. </p> <p>Detailed disclosures required by the Global Reporting Initiative Tax Standard (&#8220;GRI Tax Standard&#8221;) could result in unintended negative impacts, including the release of proprietary competitive information regarding our operations and cost structures. We believe the GRI Tax Standard&#8217;s narrow focus on corporate income taxation also oversimplifies a complex system of fiscal and public policy determinations each country makes on revenue sources, including consumption taxes, individual taxes, business taxes, etc. </p> <p>Contrary to the proponent&#8217;s assertion that its proposal would bring our Company&#8217;s disclosures in line with leading companies who already report using the GRI Tax Standard, we are not aware of any widespread adoption of the GRI Tax Standard by U.S. businesses, including by any large U.S. technology companies. We believe it would be premature to adopt this voluntary standard in advance of the forthcoming public <span><span>country-by-country</span></span> reporting in the European Union and emerging decisions from the OECD noted above. </p>\n",

The State Department report<sup>2</sup> details the highly restrictive Saudi control of all internet activities and pervasive government surveillance, arrest, and prosecution of online activity. Saudi authorities have even recruited spies inside US Twitter operations to extract personal information and spy on private communications of exiled Saudi activists &#8220;<span>with one such operative recently convicted in federal court of spying for Saudi Arabia.&#8221;</span><sup>3</sup><span> </span> </p> <p>Microsoft stated that this installation would #be consistent with Microsoft&#8217;s commitment to protecting fundamental rights&#8221; and claims that the company&#8217;s commitment to the Trusted Cloud Principles are an assurance of human rights protection yet has refused to disclose how these assurances will be enacted or enforced as there is no recognized oversight body for the Principles. The Principles require Microsoft to &#8220;Support laws that allow governments to request data through a transparent process that abides by internationally-recognized rule of law and human rights standards.&#8221; Yet the Saudi government&#8217;s laws and cloud computing regulations are in no way aligned with international human rights standards. Anti-cybercrime and data protection laws severely undermine the right to privacy, enable unchecked state surveillance, and empower Saudi state agencies to access data allowing for a sweeping crackdown on online expression. </p> <p>The company has provided no evidence that it has conducted a human rights impact assessment, or engaged impacted stakeholders as required under the <span>United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). </span>There has been no disclosure of an assessment or mitigation plans. The company&#8217;s decisions to locate cloud datacenters in human rights hot spots occur behind closed doors, without transparency. </p> <p>A report sufficient to fulfill the proposal&#8217;s essential objectives would examine the scope, implementation, and robustness of the company&#8217;s human rights due diligence processes on siting of cloud computing operations. It would assess, with an eye toward the <span>rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the standards established in the UNGPs and in the Global Network Initiative Principles, </span>the<span> </span>priorities and potential impacts on people, any mitigating actions, any tracking of outcomes, and whether the company identifies and engages rights-holders to ensure its human rights efforts are well informed. </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

Customer demand, especially on the part of multinational enterprises, engineering constraints, and regulatory requirements are all driving the establishment and operation of datacenters in more countries around the world. </p> <p>Microsoft seeks to operate responsibly and in accordance with our global commitment to respect human rights and the rule of law. When considering expansion of our datacenter footprint to new countries we conduct due diligence to assess the impact of our technologies on human rights, looking to international principles and norms such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to guide our diligence. We use what we learn from these studies to challenge our thinking, develop and refine our policies and practices, mitigate risks, and improve our technologies and how we provide them to fulfill our commitment to human rights. </p> <p>Datacenter risk mitigation measures typically take any or all of three forms: exclusion of specific types of services (e.g., consumer services), technologies (e.g., facial recognition technology), and/or specific types of customers (e.g., law enforcement agencies). </p> <p>Microsoft followed this process in evaluating the establishment of a new cloud datacenter region in Saudi Arabia and determining it could be operated in a way consistent with Microsoft&#8217;s commitment to protecting fundamental rights and focus on responsible cloud practices. </p> <p>Customer and technical demand for more cloud computing infrastructure will continue to grow, and Microsoft is not the only provider of such services. That is why we worked with other major cloud service providers to develop, agree to, and publish the Trusted Cloud Principles (<span>Announcing Trusted Cloud Principles</span>).

Misaligned or <span>non-transparent</span> funding creates reputational and legal risk that can harm the Company and its investors. Unless a company knows which candidates and political causes its funds support, it cannot assure investors that its spending aligns with values, business objectives, and policy positions. Without the information requested by this resolution, none of the board, management, or investors can assess the risks associated with political spending. </p> <p>The risks are especially serious when giving to trade associations, Super PACs, 527 committees, and &#8220;social welfare&#8221; organizations &#8211; groups that routinely pass money to or spend on behalf of candidates and political causes that a company might not wish to support. Contributions to third-party groups can lead to scandals, and widespread media coverage amplifies the risk such spending can pose. Reports show that <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> Americans are boycotting a company they spent money on because of the company&#8217;s political expenditures.<sup>1</sup> The Conference Board&#8217;s 2021 &#8220;Under a Microscope&#8221; report details these risks, discusses how to effectively manage them, and recommends the process suggested in this proposal.<sup>2</sup> </p> <p>Microsoft&#8217;s 2022 public policy agenda asserts the Company&#8217;s support for fundamental rights of people.<sup>3</sup> Following the repeal of <span>Roe&#160;v. Wade</span>, Microsoft stated that it will continue supporting employees in accessing critical healthcare like abortion.<sup>4</sup> However, according to data from the Center for Political Accountability, since 2010 Microsoft has donated 3&#160;million dollars to Republican groups<sup>5</sup> (such groups have successfully campaigned to ban nearly all abortions in fifteen states),<sup>6</sup> and at least 5&#160;million dollars overall in corporate funds to third-party groups. </p> <p>It is unclear whether Microsoft&#8217;s Board received sufficient information from these groups to assess the potential risks for the Company and stockholders, and whether the groups&#8217; expenditures aligned with Microsoft&#8217;s core values, business objectives, and policy positions. </p> <p>Therefore, it is important for Microsoft to enhance its reporting and political spending practices to eradicate risks. </p> <p>We urge Microsoft to mandate reports from third-party groups receiving Microsoft political money. </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

      " <p><span><span>Board Recommendation </span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal for the following reasons: </span></span></span></p> <p>COMPANY STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION </p> <p>The requested report is unnecessary because of Microsoft&#8217;s long track record of meeting best practices for disclosure on public policy engagement broadly and specifically around transparency and alignment related to trade associations and political groups. </p> <p>Microsoft has been recognized for its leadership on transparency around its engagement in the policy process including Political Action Committee contributions and lobbying expenditures through rankings such as the Center for Political Accountability-Zicklin Index. We strive to ensure that our participation in the political process is open, transparent, and based on reasons that are clear and justifiable to our shareholders and the public. </p> <p>Microsoft has adopted&#160;Principles for Engagement in the Public Policy Process in the United States. These principles address issues specific to the U.S. political and fundraising system and include commitments to go well beyond legally required disclosures. These principles and Microsoft&#8217;s extensive set of political disclosures are available at <span>Public policy engagement | Microsoft CSR</span> (<span><span>microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/public-policy-engagement</span></span>). </p> <p>Microsoft is a member of various industry and trade groups that represent both the tech industry and the business community at large to bring about consensus on broad policy issues that can impact Microsoft&#8217;s business objectives. Microsoft is among a relatively small number of companies that provide transparency on memberships in trade associations managed by our U.S. Government Affairs team. In June 2023 we further enhanced our political disclosures with our first-ever Lobbying Alignment Report, which provides further visibility into our policy engagement and partnerships. In particular, that report details Microsoft&#8217;s policy position and the positions of several of the largest trade associations we work with and describes the degree of alignment or misalignment between them. </p> <p>Our support of these organizations is evaluated annually by the Company&#8217;s U.S. government relations leaders based on these organizations&#8217; expertise in policy and advocacy and support of key issues of importance to Microsoft. Microsoft&#8217;s participation as a member of these various industry and trade groups comes with the understanding that we may not always agree with each position taken by the larger organization and/or other members. Some misalignment is an unavoidable consequence of any collective endeavor. Nevertheless, we monitor where and to what extent our trade associations are misaligned with the Company on such issues. Where possible, we will advocate for the trade association to come into alignment, but if an organization&#8217;s misalignment is egregious, and the membership benefits to Microsoft and its stakeholders are outweighed by the misalignments, we will reduce or end our involvement with the organization. </p> <p>From a governance and alignment perspective, the Environmental, Social, and Public Policy Committee of Microsoft&#8217;s Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing many of our environmental and social commitments and is also responsible for overseeing our public policy agenda, position on significant public policy matters, and the Company&#8217;s government relations activities and political activities and expenditures. </p> <p>Given our robust political disclosures and the focus on trade associations within our lobbying alignment report, we do not believe it to be practical or necessary for Microsoft to seek to impose reporting requirements on trade associations or political groups that we may work with. </p>\n",

ChatGPT is reportedly the fastest-growing consumer application in history.<sup>2</sup> </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>The <span>Washington Post</span> said ChatGPT users &#8220;have posted numerous examples of the tools fumbling basic factual questions or even fabricating falsehoods, complete with realistic details and fake citations.&#8221;<sup>3</sup> The <span>Guardian</span> reported that &#8220;ChatGPT is making up fake Guardian articles.&#8221;<sup>4</sup> Microsoft itself states: &#8220;Bing will sometimes misrepresent the information it finds, </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>and you may see responses that sound convincing but are incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate.&#8221;<sup>5</sup> Tests by NewsGuard found ChatGPT technology could be the most powerful tool in widely spreading misinformation.<sup>6</sup> </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>Generative AI&#8217;s disinformation may pose serious risks to democracy by manipulating public opinion, undermining institutional trust, and swaying elections. In January, Eurasia Group ranked generative AI as the third highest political risk confronting the world, warning new technologies &#8220;will be a gift to autocrats bent on undermining democracy abroad and stifling dissent at home.&#8221;<sup>7</sup> 2024 will be a critical year for elections, with a United States presidential election and significant Senate and House races.<sup>8</sup> Presidential elections will also be held in Russia and Ukraine.<sup>9</sup> </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>Shareholders are concerned that ChatGPT presents Microsoft with significant legal, financial and reputational risk. Many legal experts believe technology companies&#8217; liability shield provided under Section&#160;230 of the Communications Decency Act may not apply to content generated by ChatGPT. Senator Wyden, who wrote the law, says Section&#160;230 &#8220;has nothing to do with protecting companies from the consequences of their own actions and products.&#8221;<sup>10</sup> Experts are also debating how the principles of defamation law apply to <span>AI-generated</span> falsehoods, which open the company up to substantial litigation risk.<sup>11</sup> ChatGPT is already running afoul of regulators, with current investigations by European and Canadian data protection authorities.<sup>12</sup> </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>In March, Microsoft eliminated its entire AI ethics and society team. Employees expressed concern that this leaves Microsoft without a dedicated team to ensure its AI principles are closely tied to product design.<sup>13</sup> </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p><span>Resolved, </span>Shareholders request the Board issue a report, at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary or legally privileged information, to be published within one year of the Annual Meeting and updated annually thereafter, assessing the risks to the Company&#8217;s operations and finances as well as risks to public welfare presented by the company&#8217;s role in facilitating misinformation and disinformation disseminated or generated via artificial intelligence, and what steps, if any, the company plans to remediate those harms, and the effectiveness of such efforts. </p> <p>&#160;</p>\n",

      " <p><span><span>Board Recommendation </span></span></p> <p>&#160;</p> <p><span><span><span>The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal for the following reasons: </span></span></span></p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>COMPANY STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>We believe Microsoft&#8217;s multi-faceted program to address the risks of misinformation and disinformation is longstanding and effective. We are already engaged in multiple different types of public reporting on our efforts, including those required under the European Union&#8217;s Code of Practice on Disinformation and the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation. In a further demonstration of our commitment to transparency, Microsoft committed to the United States Government in July 2023 that it would prepare a new annual transparency report on its AI governance practices which will cover our approach to mitigating the risk of <span>AI-generated</span> misinformation and disinformation. As a result, the additional report requested by the proponent is unnecessary to inform shareholders of our approach to managing the risks of misinformation and disinformation, including those related to AI.</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>Our multi-faceted program to address the risks of misinformation and disinformation.</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>Microsoft has played a leading role in identifying and seeking to neutralize state-sponsored information influence campaigns targeting political parties in the United States, Ukraine, and democracies around the world. Our Democracy Forward Initiative works to protect campaigns from hacking, increase political advertising transparency, defend against disinformation, ensure a healthy information ecosystem, and uphold fair and secure electoral processes in democratic countries. See more at <span><span>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/protect-fundamental-rights</span></span>.</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>In July 2022, Microsoft completed the acquisition of Miburo Solutions, a cyber threat analysis and research company specializing in the detection of and response to foreign information influence. This has enabled Microsoft to expand its threat detection and analysis capabilities to shed light on the ways in which foreign actors use information operations in conjunction with cyber-attacks to achieve their objectives.&#8195; </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>At the product level, we recognize the power of generative AI and have taken numerous steps to address information integrity risks as part of our foundational commitment to Responsible AI (see further details at <span><span><span>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai</span></span></span>). On that website, there are product-specific public reports identifying disinformation and misinformation as potential risks and our efforts to address them, such as a detailed May 2023 white paper entitled &#8220;The New Bing: Our Approach to Responsible AI.&#8221;&#160;Microsoft has also committed that our generative AI image creation services, Bing Image Creator and Microsoft Designer, will use content provenance technologies to cryptographically attach content credentials to an image or video that record basic facts identifying the AI system used to create the image or video content, and whether it has been altered since creation. We believe such steps are core to maintaining a healthy information ecosystem and mitigating the risks of misinformation and disinformation.</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>Our existing and upcoming reports on our approach to mitigating the risk of misinformation and disinformation. </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>To demonstrate our commitment to transparency, we make available several public reports on our efforts to address misinformation and disinformation, such as the Microsoft Digital Defense Report available at <span>https://aka.ms/mddr</span>. We also publicly report the steps we have taken to meet our obligations as a signatory to the European Code of Practice on Disinformation. Our most recent report, filed in September 2023, specifically covered disinformation risks related to generative AI and is publicly available at <span>https://disinfocode.eu/reports-archive/</span>. (We filed similar reports under the Australian Code of Practice for Disinformation and Misinformation, the most recent version of which is available <span><span>https://news.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads</span> /prod/sites/66/2022/05/Microsoft-LinkedIn-Australian-Disinformation-Misinformation-Code-2023-report-FINAL-.pdf</span>.) In July 2023, Microsoft committed to the United States Government that it would publish an annual transparency report on our AI governance practices that will include key information about our approach to mitigating the risks of misinformation and disinformation in Microsoft&#8217;s products and services, through our partnership with OpenAI, and through tools for the broader information ecosystem. Our first annual transparency report is scheduled for release before June 2024. </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>Our investments in responsible AI staff. </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>Finally, the references to the restructuring of Microsoft&#8217;s Ethics and Society team in this proposal may leave the impression that Microsoft has <span>de-invested</span> broadly in responsible AI, which is not the case. We have invested significantly in responsible AI over the years, with new engineering systems, <span>research-led</span> incubations, and, of course, people. As we&#8217;ve publicly shared in a May 2023 blog on our responsible AI progress (<span><span><span><span><span>https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/05/01/responsible-ai-standards-principles-governance-progress/</span></span></span></span></span>) we now have nearly 350 people working on responsible AI, with just over a third of those (129 to be precise) </p>\n",

Following those changes, we made the hard decision to wind down the remainder of the Ethics&#160;&amp; Society team, which affected seven people.

If you are a registered shareholder and would like to either participate in householding or receive separate copies of this year&#8217;s and/or future proxy materials, please contact our transfer agent, Computershare, by mail at P.O. Box 43006, Providence, RI, 02940-3078; by phone at <span><span>800-285-7772,</span></span> option&#160;1; or by email at <span>web.queries@computershare.com</span>. If you are a beneficial shareholder, you may contact the broker or bank where you hold the account. </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p id=\"toc356108_41\"><span><span>Election of Directors </span></span></p> <p>Twelve directors are to be elected during the Annual Meeting to hold office until the next annual meeting and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. If, for any reason, no directors are elected at an annual meeting, a slate of directors may be elected at a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose in the manner provided by our Bylaws. The accompanying proxy will be voted in favor of the nominees presented in Part 1 &#8211; Governance and our Board of Directors to serve as directors unless the shareholder indicates to the contrary on the proxy. All of this year&#8217;s nominees are current directors, except Ms.&#160;MacGregor and Mr.&#160;Mason. The Board expects that each of the nominees will be available for election, but if any of them is unable to serve at the time the election occurs, the proxy will be voted for the election of another nominee designated by our Board. A nominee who does not receive a majority of the votes cast will not be elected. Except as explained in the next paragraph, an incumbent director who is not elected because he or she does not receive a majority vote will continue to serve as a holdover director until the earliest of: (a)&#160;90 days after the date on which the election inspector determines the voting results as to that director, (b)&#160;the date on which the Board of Directors appoints an individual to fill the office held by that director, or (c)&#160;the date of that director&#8217;s resignation. </p> <p>The Board of Directors may fill any vacancy resulting from the <span>non-election</span> of a director, or fill the office held by a holdover director, as provided in our Bylaws. The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider promptly whether to fill the office of a nominee who fails to receive a majority vote and make a recommendation to our Board about filling the office. </p> <p>The Board of Directors will act on the Governance and Nominating Committee&#8217;s recommendation and within 90 days after certification of the shareholder vote will disclose publicly its decision. </p> <p>Additional details about this process are specified in our Bylaws, which are available on our website at <span>aka.ms/policiesandguidelines.</span> </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p id=\"toc356108_42\"><span><span>Voting </span></span></p> <p id=\"toc356108_43\">Shareholders Entitled to Vote; Quorum </p> <p>Shareholders of record at the close of business on September&#160;29, 2023, will be entitled to vote during the Annual Meeting on the basis of one vote for each share held. Shareholders as of the record date are encouraged to vote prior to the meeting (1)&#160;via the Internet, (2)&#160;by phone, or (3)&#160;if you received your proxy materials by mail, by signing, dating, and returning the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form. On September&#160;29, 2023, there were 7,429,030,596 shares of common stock outstanding, held of record by 83,323 shareholders. </p> <p>A majority of the outstanding shares of Microsoft common stock is required to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. The shares of a shareholder whose ballot on any or all proposals is marked as &#8220;abstain&#8221; or, in the case of an uncontested election of directors, &#8220;withheld,&#8221; will be included in the number of shares present during the Annual Meeting to determine whether a quorum is present. </p> <p id=\"toc356108_44\">Vote Required; Effect of Abstentions and Broker <span>Non-Votes</span> </p> <p>For each nominee and proposal submitted to the shareholders for a vote, approval requires a vote of the majority of the votes cast. A majority of votes cast means the number of shares cast &#8220;for&#8221; a nominee or proposal exceeds the number of shares cast &#8220;against&#8221; that nominee or proposal. Abstentions will not be counted as votes cast. Uninstructed shares will not be counted as votes cast except with respect to the Ratification of the Selection of our Independent Auditor, for which brokers and custodians have discretion to vote. A ballot for a nominee that is marked &#8220;withheld&#8221; will also not be counted as a vote cast. </p>\n",
